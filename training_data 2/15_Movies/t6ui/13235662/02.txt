Abstract
Weekly box office revenues for approximately 100 successful motion pictures are analyzed by use of a finite
mixture regression technique to determine if regular sales patterns emerge. Based on an exponential decay model
applied to market share data, four clusters of movies, varying in opening strength and decay rate, are found.
Characteristics of the clusters and implications for future research are discussed.
Key words: Motion pictures, product lifestyle, market segmentation, finite mixture
Introduction
The movie industry, like a number of other product categories in the entertainment and
fashion industries, is characterized by regular new product or model introductions. These
introductions are vital for the success of the business. In the case of movies, for instance,
approximately 300 movies are released annually with an average life span (time in the￾atrical release) of less than 10 weeks (Radas and Shugan, 1996). Moreover, an average
movie is estimated to cost $40 million to produce and $20 million to distribute and
market, but less than 70% of movies are profitable (Vogel 1994). With major industries
depending upon the regular introduction of new models with short life spans, it is impor￾tant to understand the sales patterns of these products.
In this paper our goal is to determine if there are regular patterns in the box office
revenues of major motion pictures over time. Existing approaches to the study of box
office revenues emphasize specific characteristics or genre of movies—e.g., action movies
need “recognizable names to ensure at least a strong opening weekend,” according to a
front page article in Variety (March 24, 1997). More generally, while motion picture
executives and industry professionals appear to be able to make good predictions of a
movie’s success just before it opens (see Krider and Weinberg 1998 for evidence on this),

attempts “to find movie characteristics that co-vary with attendance … [have had some
success], but the predictive power of these variables could be poor and appears to be
unstable over time.” (Eliashberg and Shugan, 1997, p.69).1 Our concern is not with
prediction, but rather with understanding sales histories. In particular, our approach fo￾cuses on the actual weekly box office revenues of movies to see if there are clusters of
movies which follow relatively consistent sales patterns and to see if these patterns relate
to variables that are available before a movie’s release.
To accomplish this goal, we analyze weekly market share data for 102 major motion
pictures released between December 1990 and April 1992. We employ a finite mixture
regression methodology (Jedidi, Kohli, and DeSarbo, 1996; Helsen, Jedidi, and DeSarbo,
1993) for analysis. The next section of the paper describes the data we use, followed by
a brief description of the methodology. We then present our results, along with conclu￾sions and suggestions for future research.
Data
Our focus is on major motion pictures, which account for the bulk of North American box
office revenues. Each week, Variety publishes a list of the 50 (or 60) top grossing films for
the week. We confine our analysis to films which were among the top 5 movies for at least
one week during the period December 1990 to April 1992.2 Our data include about 25%
of the movies released by Hollywood, but represent about 80% of box office revenues
during the time periods studied.3
To control for the effects of seasonality and competition, we transform our revenue data
into market share terms. While the predominant pattern for major motion pictures is
wide-release and mass-marketing, there are, at times, a few “sleepers,” or unexpected hits
which open slowly and gradually build an audience.4 These, while memorable, are un￾usual; moreover, as a June 2, 1997 front page Variety headline speculates, “megapix may
make ‘sleepers’ extinct.” In our data set, there are only two such movies—“Driving Miss
Daisy” and “Reversal of Fortune”—and they were eliminated from further analysis. The
remaining 102 movies follow a consistent pattern of having their largest market share in
their first week of wide release, and then declining in an approximately exponential decay
pattern. (See Krider and Weinberg, 1998 for an analysis of the revenue patterns of indi￾vidual movies.)
Consequently, we postulate the following exponential decay model (omitting error
terms) for each movie’s market share over time:
Sharet 5 e
a2b t
, where t 5 0, 1, 2,… (1)
and a is a parameter capturing the opening share and b is the decay constant.

Methodology
One approach to looking for clusters in movie share-of-revenue patterns would be to
conduct a regression analysis for each of the movies and then cluster the movies on the
basis of the resulting parameter values. However, as discussed by Helsen, Jedidi, and
DeSarbo (1993), a finite mixture approach has a number of advantages over this tradi￾tional approach. In particular, it helps to overcome problems of short time series and
limited data for each movie by simultaneously determining movie clusters and parameter
estimates. In addition, the number of clusters is determined based on statistical tests that
involve the use of various information criteria, the most popular of which is the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) which penalizes for overparametrization. This requires esti￾mating the finite mixture model for different number of clusters and then choosing the
solution with minimum BIC. The methodology is described in detail in Jedidi, Kohli, and
DeSarbo (1996) and Helsen, Jedidi, and DeSarbo (1993).
We applied the finite mixture regression procedure, modified for the exponential decay
function, equation (1), and generated parameter estimates and BIC measures while vary￾ing the number of clusters from 1 to 5.
Results
For the 102 movies that we analyzed, the most appropriate structure involves 4 clusters
(see Table 1). This structure has the minimum BIC; it also exhibits an elbow in its
likelihood function and almost all movies have a posterior probability greater than 90% of
belonging to a primary cluster as reflected by the high 0.925 entropy measure.5 (See Table
1.) Appendix A reports the classification results for the movies. Thus, the four cluster
structure appears to discriminate well among the movies, at the same time that it accounts
for a substantial portion of the variability among movies.
Table 2 presents the parameter estimates for each of the four clusters. We use these
estimates to compute opening shares and decay rates. The clusters differ both in opening
share and in decay rate, as shown in Figure 1.
Clusters 1 (what we call “Hollywood Heros”) and 2 (“Mega Movies”) represent the
most successful movies. Cluster 1, (the larger cluster) accounting for 19% of the movies,
opens with a 22.6% share and declines at a rate of 20% per week. In contrast, Cluster 2

accounting for 7% of the movies, opens with a slightly smaller opening share of 20% but
declines at a very low rate of only 10% per week. The next two clusters, approximately
equal in size, account for nearly three quarters of the movies in our sample. The third
cluster, representing 38% of the movies in our sample, opens with a market share of 8%,
which then falls at a fairly rapid rate of 36% per week. This set of movies, which we term

“Fast Fade,” is the least successful set of movies in our study. Most of these movies
achieve a highest ranking of fourth or fifth for one week, and then decline rapidly. Our
final cluster (“Fair Flicks”), consisting of 36% of the movies, declines at a rate of 23%
after obtaining an opening week share of 10.5%. Interestingly, while the smallest cluster
(Mega Movies) has the highest cumulative share per movie, the largest cluster in terms of
number of movies (Cluster 3), has the smallest cumulative share per movie.
By calculating the cumulative share over the median run length (12.5 weeks) for movies
in our sample, it can be seen that the effect of a slower decline is substantial. Cluster 2
opens at a slightly lower share (20%) than Cluster 1 (23%), but the slower declining
Cluster 2 movies have cumulative revenue nearly 70% (192/113) greater than those for
Cluster 1. The rapidly declining Cluster 3 earns about one-third of its revenue in the first
week of wide-release and will usually have a brief theatrical release. The positive effect of
a slow decay is reinforced further, since slowly declining movies are likely to be shown for
a longer period of time in theaters.
Posterior analysis
Table 3 presents characteristics of the movies in each of the four clusters. While we would
not suggest that the overall appeal of a movie can be reduced to a weighted summation of
its characteristics, previous research (Wallace, Seigerman, and Holbrook 1993; Sawhney
and Eliashberg 1996) has reported some success in forecasting revenues based on such
characteristics. Based on this literature, we selected a set of variables that would be
available before a movie is released, a set that would reflect the overall quality of the
movie, and a set of variables external to the movie. The first set of variables included the
genre of the movie, whether the movie included major stars (as classified by Quigley’s
Motion Picture Almanac, Klain, 1990), the Motion Picture of America Association’s
(MPAA) classification of the movie as R, PG-13, or G/PG (none of the [successful]
movies in our sample were rated X and too few were rated G to be kept as a separate
category), and whether the movie was a sequel or not. A number of measures of quality
are available. To capture the industry’s view, we used a variable indicating whether or not
the movie was nominated for one of the major (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading
or Supporting Male or Female Actor) academy awards. To capture the public’s view more
generally, we relied on the 5 point rating (1 5 lowest, 5 5 highest) provided by Block￾buster Entertainment (Castell, 1996). External factors were measures of competitive in￾tensity, distribution, and seasonality. Since competing movies have the strongest draw in
the earliest parts of their runs, our competitive intensity measures focused on newly
opened competing movies. One measure (OPENST) looked at movies competing with the
target movie at the time of opening. It is the number of competing movies that are in either
their first or second week when the target movie opens. (Two other measures—counting
movies in their first week only, or in first, second or third weeks—led to results similar to
those reported below). This measure focuses on competition at a movie’s opening. Be￾cause the target movie is described in terms of its opening and decay, a second measure
of competitive intensity was the average number of new movies opening per week over the

entire run of the movie (OPENWK). Distribution intensity was captured by the maximum
number of screens (MAXSCREENS) the movie played on in any week, over its run.
Seasonality was measured by a dummy variable that takes the value one for movies
released in the high Christmas season (the four weeks starting mid-December), and the
summer season, (mid-May to the first week in September), and zero for those released in
the remainder of the year.
To determine whether these characteristics were associated with cluster membership,
we ran a discriminant analysis in which each of the categories for genre and MPAA ratings
were treated as 0, 1 dummy variables.6 Two discriminant functions were significant, with
the first dimension accounting for 74% of the variance (see Figure 2). The overall hit rate
of 58% is much higher than chance as well as being higher than the maximum chance
criterion (Cluster 3 has 38% of movies). The following eight variables were selected at a
significance level of p , 0.05 by the stepwise discriminant analysis procedure:
• SEQUEL
• G/PG (MPAA dummy for G or PG ratings)
• ACADEMY AWARD WINNER
• Blockbuster’s Movie RATINGS

Interestingly, none of the genre classifications are significant. While Cluster 2 (“Mega
Movies”) does not include certain categories (e.g., Horror), genre does not contribute
significantly to the overall categorization scheme.
The characteristics of the clusters are quite intriguing and reveal potentially interesting
patterns both in industry strategy and audience characteristics. Starting with Cluster 3,
“Fast Fade,” we see that almost half of these movies are in the crime, horror, and action
categories. This cluster, accounting for more movies than any other, has the lowest open￾ing share and the highest decay rate. While some of the movies in this cluster are
undoubtedly those for which more was hoped, most of the movies are targeted at a
(probably male) segment that wants action. Movie producers appear to have recognized
this; as shown in Figure 2, the movies do not earn academy award nominations or high
ratings from critics. The data in Table 2 show that they infrequently use stars in their
movies. Moreover, the producers seem to know that these movies are unlikely to gather a
showing in a high number of screens. Thus, Cluster 3 movies tend to avoid the high
season; they appear at a time when there are more likely to be a significant number of
other (presumably also of lower quality) movies in distribution. Just as the movies in this
cluster are characterized by action, so is the audience. With a high decay rate, the audience
quickly moves on to other movies.7
And where do these people go? Most people go to the seven movies in Cluster 2, the
Mega Movies. What distinguishes this cluster from the others, as indicated by Dimension
2, is that it produces high quality movies. However, there are other factors as well. Aside
from one movie, Little Mermaid, it avoids the G-PG classification and thus appeals to a
wide audience who wants at least a little “edge” in their movies. This cluster contains no
sequels, thus appearing “fresh” to its audience. Interestingly, the movies in this cluster
tend to avoid the high season, which may provide them with sufficient strength to over￾come the competition they face in the early weeks of their release. Presumably it is the
quality of these movies (BBRA) which provides them with a very low decay rate. As
indicated in Figure 1, the maximum number of screens is about equally important for both
Clusters 1 and 2, but it is Cluster 2’s quality which allows it to sustain an audience.
Cluster 1 also contains movies of high quality. However, in this case, while these
movies received an equivalent percentage of academy award nominations, the overall
reaction to these movies as measured by Blockbuster’s ratings is not as strong. Moreover,
Cluster 1 movies seem to follow a releasing strategy that avoids competition both in the
opening weeks (OPENST) and throughout its run.
Cluster 4 movies are in many ways similar to Cluster 1 movies, except they don’t
achieve the same quality standard. This weakness to a large part may be recognized early
on, as they are released to fewer screens and face stiffer competition than Cluster 1
movies. Market forces thus exacerbate the difficulties, but are not the underlying cause.
To explore further this intuition, we re-ran the analysis without the external factors
(SEASONALITY, MAXSCREENS, OPENST, OPENWK) and found that virtually the
same movie-related factors remained significant, and that the qualitative structure of the
map was nearly identical.8 One difference is that without OPENWK, the average com￾petitive intensity over the run, Clusters 3 and 4 are not as strongly separated.

Conclusions, limitations, and future research
While not all major movies are alike, neither are their sales patterns all different. We find
that the market share patterns for major North American movies (released between De￾cember 1990 and April 1992) can be grouped into four main clusters, involving differ￾ences in both opening strength and decay rate. We focus on major movies because they
account for the vast majority of revenues, and presumably profits, although Hollywood
accounting is, at times, baffling. (See Vogel 1994.)
Our research has a number of limitations. Movies with lower box office revenues would
undoubtedly add different patterns. One such pattern would be a very small opening share
followed by a rapid decay, but there may be other patterns as well. The approach we
develop here could be applied to a much larger sample size.
In addition to being limited to major movies, we also look at only one time period (i.e.,
December 1990–April 1992) and only one market. The study could be replicated over
other data sets to determine the stability of the clusters over time. Since Hollywood
generally opens its movies in North America and then distributes them to other countries
at a later date, it would be interesting to see if other countries have similar cluster
structures.
Differences in cluster structures across countries could be explained by distribution
characteristics in each country, cultural factors or other elements. In a preliminary analy￾sis, we found that data for movies shown in Hong Kong also form four clusters, but that
the clusters seem to have different opening share and decay patterns. This result is not
unexpected, given that movie runs are defined in Hong Kong by days rather than by weeks.
An interesting area of future research, following the direction established by Helsen,
Jedidi, and DeSarbo (1993), would be to examine sales patterns across countries and
determine if groups of countries emerge which have similar patterns. This might help
movie producers develop an international releasing strategy that is sensitive to market
factors. This is particularly important, since Hollywood earns more box-office revenues
from outside North America than from North America itself.
If consistent clustering patterns can be established, either country-by-country or glo￾bally, then an interesting next step would be to determine how accurately movie charac￾teristics can be used to estimate cluster membership. In turn, if movies can be assigned to
clusters on a reliable basis, then this information can perhaps be used to improve early
forecasts of a movie’s eventual revenue streams.

Notes
1. New approaches, based on innovative marketing research models, appear to hold promise for improvement
in forecasting accuracy. See, for example, Sawhney and Eliashberg, (1996). In addition, in some specific
instances, successful forecasting and planning models have been developed and implemented. For example,
in the performing arts, see Weinberg (1986).
2. The same set of movies was analyzed by Krider and Weinberg (1998).
3. The distinction between the “two Hollywoods,” one aiming to produce high grossing blockbusters and the
other, more independent sector is now accepted. The latter sector, often appealing to a tightly targeted
audience, can be highly profitable. The artistic merits of such a separation are debatable, as Gabler (1988,
p.78) notes: “There are now small films for older arty audiences and big films for younger action-oriented
ones, which puts the movies exactly where literature, music, dance and art are: split. Even more important,
the segregated audience has allowed film makers to segregate themselves, too. … Now that the independents
have relieved their film makers of the obligation to reach a large audience and studios have relieved theirs
of the obligation to make intelligently crafted pictures, the split between art and entertainment is larger than
ever and, one fears, never the twain shall meet.”
4. There are also disappointments; in 1997, these included “Volcano” (with a loss of $40 million) and
“Father’s Day.” Klady, 1997).
5. Entropy is bounded by 0 and 1. A value close to 0 indicates that the posterior probabilities are not well
separated (i.e., it is difficult to classify movies into distinct groups).
6. All movie characteristics are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance to facilitate comparison of
effects.
7. DeVany and Walls (1997), while using a different approach, also obtain results which imply “that audiences
have a taste for variety, (p. 795).”
8. The dummy variable for G/PG was replaced by the dummy variable for R.
