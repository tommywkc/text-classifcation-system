Abstract. We address the question of the quality of movies produced between 1950 and 1970.
A first outcome of our analysis is that the quality assessments made during the Cannes Festival,
and to a lesser degree, by the U.S. Academy are short-lasting. In contrast to this, consumers seem
consistent over time. There is, however, one issue on which experts agree as well as consumers:
American movies dominate both in terms of commercial success and in terms of quality. There is less
agreement, and sometimes there is even dissent concerning other dimensions. This does not come as
a surprise and merely indicates that there is hardly a common yardstick along which the quality of
a movie can be measured. Therefore, decomposing a work of art into quantifiable characteristics –
even in a subjective but possibly unanimous way – would make it possible to explain the divergences
between audiences and changes of appreciation over time.
Key words: motion picture, quality measures in art
1. Introduction
Quality is an important characteristic in determining the demand for a commodity.
This is a fortiori true for works of art, since aesthetic quality is often the main, in
many cases the only, reason for “consuming” them. Economists are more used to
think of quality in terms of vertically differentiated goods for which consumers are
unanimous in agreeing that more of a given objective characteristic, say the dimen￾sions of a flat, provides more utility. This concept can hardly be used to describe
works of art – a large painting does not contain more quality than a small one.
Works of art can much better be understood as being horizontally differentiated –
a work by Rubens is preferred to a work by Beuys by some consumers, a Beuys to
a Rubens by others, even if both are of the same size – but apart from defining the
concept, economists have had little to add.1
This is more the playground of philosophers who have been interested in the
subject for many centuries, starting as early as Plato in his Republic. Since then,
many have contributed to the literature, but there is little consensus among them on
issues other than the following three basic ideas:
(i) Quality assessments should be left to specialists who are familiar with the
experience of works of art (Budd, 1995, p. 12).
270 VICTOR GINSBURGH AND SHEILA WEYERS
(ii) Some unanimous, even if subjective, judgment is necessary (Budd, 1995,
p. 182).
(iii) Only time makes it possible to separate fashion from art (Jimenez, 1997,
p. 427).
The concept of “unanimity” is invoked by both economists and philosophers, and
may provide some link between vertical and horizontal differentiation. However
there are differences that remain important. Philosophers put the burden of the
proof of quality on specialists, economists think that the choice should be left to
consumers; philosophers stress the importance of time, and this is not raised by
economists in this context.
On the other hand, measuring quality – as is necessary to make operational the
economic concept of vertical differentiation – is rarely stressed by philosophers,
and even less so by art historians.2 But, surprisingly, it is even criticized by cultural
economists. Throsby (1990), for example, believes that quality characteristics do
not necessarily have to be measured along numerical scales, and that we should
recognize that “many facets of quality can be specified without measurement”.
In this paper, we try to contribute to the issue, by analyzing how movies, pro￾duced between 1950 and 1970, can and have been evaluated over time. We chose
this relatively remote period of production since it allows us to compare judgments
passed by general audiences as well as by specialists shortly after the movie was
produced, with those passed many years later, when commercial interests have
receded and one can, at least according to philosophers, expect judgment to be
based on artistic quality only.
Most papers on movies implicitly relate quality to box office results (or rental
income), i.e., to short-run evaluations made by consumers. Hirschman and Pieros
(1985) are among the first to study the relationships between three short-term in￾dicators of success: Reviews by professional critics,3 recognition via awards, and
box office data. They find that reviews and awards produce consistent choices, but
that both are negatively correlated with audience receipts. Smith and Smith (1986)
also investigate the determinants of success. They compare the influence of various
characteristics (mainly types of awards) for movies released during three decades
(1950s and before, 1960s and 1970s) and find that the short-run determinants of
success have changed substantially over time. Wallace, Seigerman and Holbrook
(1993) try to price the worth of movie stars by running hedonic regressions of
rental income on movie characteristics that include dummy variables representing
movie stars. These studies are extended by Prag and Casavant (1994), who show
that academy awards and the presence of major stars contribute significantly to
revenue only when marketing expenditures are not included in the regressions,
thus casting doubt on the role of experts who distribute the awards. This result
may even imply that experts could be influenced by advertising and marketing
expenditures, when awarding Oscars. Eliashberg and Shugan (1997) concentrate
on the role of critics on box office revenue and show that positive reviews have no
impact on box office performance in the short run (weeks 1–4 after the release of
ON THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF MOVIES 271
the movie), but have a significant influence for later weeks (weeks 5–8) as well as
for cumulative receipts. They believe that if moviegoers were influenced by critics,
reviews should be correlated with early box office revenue (realized shortly after
the reviews are published). Since this is not the case, their finding suggests that
critics are predictors rather than influencers of box office numbers. Throsby (1990)
uses press reviews of performances, measured against a cardinal scale to estimate
demand and supply functions for various (theatre) companies. Finally, there exist
many papers which study the pure dynamics of success (or failure), by using time
series of box office revenues; see de Vany and Walls (1996, 1997), Krider and
Weinberg (1998) and Sawhney and Eliashberg (1996). Though in many cases, the
role of specialists (movie critics and awards) is thus recognized, as suggested by
philosophers in (i), the role of time, suggested by them in (iii), is never taken into
consideration. This is particularly important in the case of movies, since short-run
evaluations and success may be due to heavy marketing, viz. Titanic or Jurassic
Park, rather than to aesthetic or artistic quality.
We are not concerned with the determinants of success. Instead we analyze the
various evaluations made at the time the movie was produced and many years later,
both by specialists and critics – as suggested by art philosophers – and by con￾sumers – as suggested by economists who believe in consumers’ sovereignty. Our
paper aims thus at comparing four types of evaluations and examining whether spe￾cialists and consumers have consistent opinions and whether short-run qualitative
evaluations have some lasting power.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data set that we
constructed to analyze the phenomenon, while Section 3 is devoted to the analysis.
In Section 4, we draw some conclusions.
2. Data
We collected judgments made by movie specialists – critics, as well as profession￾als of the motion picture industry, such as actors, directors, etc. – and by consumers.
For the short-run, awards are probably the best measure of what movie specialists
think. They pick productions which are fashionable at the time the movie is pro￾duced and which include new technical devices, specific movie stars or topics,
temporary moral yardsticks, etc. We chose to include two well-known series of
awards, which existed already in the early 1950s: Oscars for best movies, awarded
by the U.S. Academy and Palmes d’Or distributed during the Cannes Festival.
Long-run quality assessments are obtained by using recent lists of “best movies of
all times”, as well as ratings quoted in two well-known movie guides (an American
and a French).
Box office data are used to measure what consumers think of a production.
These are collected in a relatively consistent way as long as the newly produced
movie is shown in large theatres (owned or controlled by distributors or producers).
They are not systematically collected later, when the movie is shown in small
272 VICTOR GINSBURGH AND SHEILA WEYERS
theatres, or by film archives. Therefore, we rely on the frequency with which a
movie is shown on TV as a long-run audience measure. A series of objections
may come to mind with this measure. First, the choice may reflect the taste of the
TV-channel rather than the taste of consumers and some movies – especially those
produced by or belonging to U.S. majors – are more easily accessible than others.
However, given the increasingly commercial nature of most private and public TV￾channels, it is likely that at least some rationality prevails, and that the public “gets
what it expects”. Secondly, there is the time of the day during which a movie is
shown. One may think that movies shown during prime-time should be given more
importance than those shown after midnight. However, given that many households
own video-recorders, this may not really be an issue today, since late movies (as
well as early ones) can be recorded at very little cost.
The data set that we constructed consists of the union of the following two
sets of movies produced between 1950 and 1970: (1) productions which were
distinguished by the U.S. Academy (nominees and Oscars for best movie and best
foreign movie) or in Cannes (Palme d’Or and other equivalent awards); (2) movies
which are included in five lists of “best movies of all times”, two of which are
international, and three are national (British, American and German4). This makes
for a total of 249 films for which we collected two sets of movie-guide ratings
(Maltin, 1997; Tulard, 1997), box office data and number of broadcasts by 17
channels in five European countries in the early 1990s. The database is described
in more detail in the Appendix.
In most of the analysis carried out in Section 3, the various quality indicators
are aggregated, in order to produce results that are statistically meaningful. Awards
are aggregated into five classes: (a) Palmes d’Or at the Cannes Festival, (b) Other
Cannes awards, (c) Oscars for best movie, (d) Other U.S. awards (nominees for
best movie and Oscars for best foreign movie) and (e) no award. Movies included
in one of the five “best movie” lists are attributed a “1” for present (0 for absent)
and these numbers are added, so that a movie that is present in m lists gets a mark
of m ≤ 5 for the “list” variable. We did the same for box office data, attributing a
“1” to a movie present in a box office list (and 0 otherwise), and added the “1” to
obtain the “box office” variable.5
In order to reduce the number of unrated movies by either Maltin or Tulard,
we attributed to each movie the maximum between the two ratings, instead of
averaging them, as would have been natural.6
3. Analysis
Before turning to the comparisons between evaluations, we provide some descrip￾tive statistics concerning the 249 movies of our sample.
Table I provides an overview by country of production. As can be seen from the
first two lines, American movies come out much better than others, though the U.S.
produces less movies than Europe. The next line of the table shows the number of

movies which were awarded prizes in Cannes and by the U.S. Academy. American
movies dominate but there is a slight bias since, the award for Best Movie is only
given to films produced in the English language (note, however, that Oscars for
Best Foreign Language Film of the Year are also included). Finally, for each type
of evaluation (lists, ratings, box office and number of broadcasts), the table gives
the number of movies which appear at least once (for ratings, it is the number
of films whose marks are at least equal to 3.5) as well as averages: The average
number of best movie lists or of box office lists in which a movie is present, the
average rating, and the average number of TV shows.
The table clearly indicates that American movies dominate in terms of “qual￾ity”, as judged by specialists and consumers, both in the short and the long run. The
only exception is that French, Italian and Japanese movies are, on average, present
in more best movie lists than American movies, but almost half of the movies
(56/122) that appear in such lists are American.
Table II is similar to Table I, but compares evaluations made for movies nom￾inated or rewarded in Cannes and by the U.S. Academy. Movies rewarded by the
U.S. Academy are dominant: They do better than Cannes on all accounts. It is very
interesting to note that there is an important number of movies (75) which were not

selected in Cannes or by the U.S. Academy (“No award”) and which do quite well
one generation later. This is an issue to which we will come back.
Most of the analysis which follows will essentially compare evaluations, the
consistency of which can be checked according to two criteria:
(a) Consistency between short- and long-run evaluations. How are movies
chosen in Cannes and by the U.S. Academy evaluated later (agreement between
awards and lists or ratings); how are top box office movies considered by con￾sumers many years later (agreement between box office receipts and broadcasting
frequency).
(b) Consistency between experts and consumers. Is there agreement between
judgments made just after the movie was released (awards and box office receipts)
and one generation later (lists, ratings and broadcasting frequency).
We also compare evaluations made by experts across countries (for instance, do
the U.S. and the U.K. lists agree; do the French and the U.S. ratings agree) and
evaluations made by experts and consumers within a country (e.g. the U.S. list and
the U.S. box office).
Since the data are in the form of number of objects which fall in various cat￾egories (number of movies rated 0, 1, 2, etc.), we construct contingency tables and
use nonparametric statistics, more specifically the χ2-test for independent samples

(see, e.g., Siegel, 1956). A word of caution is however necessary. The data at hand
are not randomly drawn, but consist of a selection of 249 among some 20,000
movies produced between 1950 and 1970. Therefore, the χ2-statistics and the test￾values that we give are merely indications of orders of magnitude and should be
taken with a pinch of salt. Moreover, the power of the χ2-test decreases if too many
cells in the contingency tables contain zeros. This led us to aggregate data into two
categories (characteristic present or absent) and proceed with 2 × 2 contingency
tables.
3.1. SHORT- AND LONG-RUN EVALUATIONS
Table III shows whether short-run evaluations, made in Cannes or in Hollywood,
stand the test of time. The χ2-statistics show that there is little or no consistency
between short- and long-run opinions (awards and ratings). But there is even worse
since the association between the judgments expressed in best movie lists and those
passed when awards were distributed is strong but negative.
This leads us to believe that evaluations which are made shortly after the movie
comes out are prone to fashion, if not to political or economic influence. If one
follows art philosophers who claim that time plays an important role, this indicates
that awards do not recognize artistic quality, since their discriminant power is short
lasting, and they do not select the movies which will last, since many movies get
listed later, but were not selected.
Consumers seem to be more consistent in their evaluations, since box office
receipts are strongly and positively correlated with the number of times a movie
appears on television long after having been produced.

3.2. MOVIE SPECIALISTS AND CONSUMERS
The results of the comparisons beween evaluations made by movie experts and
consumers are displayed in Table IV and show that awards are positively as￾sociated with box office receipts. This is in contrast with the rather surprising
result in Hirschman and Pieros (1985), who conclude, though on the basis of ten
observations only, that this correlation is negative.
There is, however, a serious discrepancy between the judgments made by spe￾cialists and by consumers, as is apparent from the absence of association between
best movie lists and TV-broadcasts and between lists and box office data. Note that
this is not the case with ratings, but there are many more movies that are highly
rated by Maltin and Tulard than there are movies appearing in best movie lists
(each of which usually includes a hundred movies only).
3.3. DO MOVIE SPECIALISTS AGREE
In Table V, we compare all couples of “best movie” lists, as well as the French and
the U.S. ratings. The association is strong (and positive) between the American and
the British lists, which is not too surprising, and it is almost significant between the
British choice and the one made for the Luxembourg film festival in 1995. In all
other cases, there is no dissent, but no agreement either.

3.4. WITHIN COUNTRY CONSISTENCY
We now ask the same question as above, but concentrate on evaluations made
by experts and consumers within the same country. Our results are displayed in
Table VI and show that there is no within-country consistency either. The U.S. is
however an exception, since in two of the three comparisons, there is agreement.7
It is tempting to conclude that in the U.S., tastes seem to be more uniform over
individuals and over time.
4. Conclusions
A first outcome of our analysis is that the quality assessments made during the
Cannes Festival, and to a lesser degree, by the U.S. Academy are short-lasting.
From the 174 movies rewarded or nominated between 1950 and 1970, only 47
belong to the 122 movies produced during these years and selected, later on, as
best movies. This could be seen as a consequence of the increasing number of
movies over time, leaving less room for older movies, which end up disappearing
from best movie lists (usually, limited to one hundred titles) established much later.
But this does not explain why 75 out of the 122 movies considered as best movies
nowadays received no award (and were not even nominated). Judges in Cannes and
Hollywood are thus both short-sighted and unselective: They cannot discriminate
between good quality movies and other movies. This is similar to what happens
for other forms of art, such as paintings, where the appreciation of what is qual￾ity also changes over time: Some artists or entire schools (e.g., the 17th Century
Bolognese painters, or the Pre-raphaelites, between 1900 and 1960) get forgotten,
while others, such as Greco or Vermeer are rediscovered (see, e.g., Haskell, 1980).
In contrast to this, consumers seem to be more time-consistent, since box office
receipts remain positively associated with the number of times a movie is shown
on television one generation later.
Consumers and experts agree when movies come out: Award-winning pictures
are ranked high in box office statistics, but this may be due to many other factors
than quality. There is less agreement some years later, and the two groups seem
either to value different attributes or value differently the same attributes.
There is, however one issue on which there is an international consensus among
experts and consumers: American movies dominate both in terms of commercial
success and in terms of long-lasting quality, since 56 out of a total of 122 best
movies are American. Even if consumers are likely to be influenced by the power,
the marketing and the organization of the American film industry, one may hope
that experts are less so, especially one generation after the movie is out.
But, being “American” is not a quality per se. In the spirit of Lancaster (1966), it
should be possible to decompose works of art into basic characteristics which could
be quantified by as many experts as possible, even if this judgment is subjective (re￾call suggestion (ii) above made by philosophers). It is then the varying appreciation
over time – by consumers as well as by experts – of each characteristic that could
ON THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF MOVIES 279
explain the differences in the appreciation of global quality, seen as a weighted
combination of characteristics. In this way, some of the “horizontal” qualities of
works of art can be made “vertical”. This is probably what, long before Lancaster,
the French art historian de Piles (1708) had in mind when he wrote that8 “the true
understanding of painting consists in knowing whether a picture is good or bad, in
distinguishing between that which is good in a certain work and that which is bad,
and in giving reasons for one’s judgment”. This led him to grade on a scale of 20,
characteristics such as composition, drawing, color and expression, for a group of
painters, and rank them accordingly.
For movies, an answer in this direction is given by D. Moïsi, deputy director
of the Paris-based Institut Français des Relations Internationales. Writing about
the triumph of American culture, and more specifically about the universality of
American movies, he suggests that9 “[. . . ] The success of Hollywood, beyond pure
economic factors, can be attributed to two main things: On the one hand, the nature
of the message, and on the other, its ubiquity and familiarity. From the master￾pieces of Frank Capra [. . . ] to Stephen Spielberg [. . . ], the message is the same –
individuals can make a difference. If you want to do it, you can. This triumph of
the individual [. . . ] is universal. It contrasts drastically with the French romance:
A loves B, who loves C, who loves D”.
Appendix. The Database
The data set that we constructed consists of the union of the following sets of
movies produced between 1950 and 1970.
(a) U.S. Academy Awards. Movies which were awarded an Oscar for “Best
Picture of the Year” as well as those nominated for that Oscar (without necessarily
receiving it); all the movies which won the Oscar for “Best Foreign Language Film
of the Year”. The list includes 21 Best Picture awards, 84 other nominated and 15
Best Foreign awards (which are awarded since 1956 only). See Annual Academy
Awards (1998).
(b) Cannes Festival. Movies which were awarded one of the following awards
at the Cannes Festival: “Palme d’Or” (“Grand Prix du Festival International du
Film” before 1955), “Prix Spécial (du Jury)”, “Mention exceptionnelle” and “Prix
International”, “Prix de la Critique Internationale” depending on the years, since
mentions keep changing. No awards were attributed in 1950 and 1968. The data
include 24 Palmes d’Or (on several occasions, more than one Palme d’Or was
awarded) and 41 other awards. See Toscan du Plantier (1997).
(c) “Best movies of all time.” Movies which were listed in a certain number of
“best movies of all time” lists; we were able to retrieve two “international” lists,
and three “national” lists produced in the U.K., the U.S. and Germany:10
− Cinémathèque Municipale du Luxembourg (1995). This list of 100 movies
was set up as follows: 100 international key figures of the movie world were
280 VICTOR GINSBURGH AND SHEILA WEYERS
each asked to quote “their preferred movie”. All the movies so chosen (100 in
total) were shown by the Cinémathèque Municipale de Luxembourg in 1995,
year during which the city of Luxemburg had been selected as European City
of Culture. Out of this total of 100 movies, 50 were produced between 1950
and 1970.
− Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF) (1995). This list of
movies was set up as follows: 37 film archives (belonging to 29 countries)
were asked to select as many movies as they wished, to represent what they
thought to be “the best movies in the world”. We selected the 110 movies that
received the largest number of votes (5 or more).11 Out of this total, 35 were
produced between 1950 and 1970.
− Norman (1992). This is a choice made by B. Norman for the U.K. Out of the
total of 100 movies, 34 movies were produced between 1950 and 1970.
− Movie Guide (1997). This list contains 100 “best movies of all time”, selected
by U.S. movie critics; 33 were produced between 1950 and 1970.
− Koelsner (1995). These four volumes contain “best movies” chosen by a
group of German specialists, but since the number of films listed is much
larger than 100, we discarded all those which were not included in any of the
previous lists. No new movie is thus added to the previous ones; the German
list includes 69 movies.
This produced a list of 249 movies. For each of these, we added three extra pieces
of information:
(a) Box office information. We included box office statistics for the U.K., the
U.S. and France. See Swern (1995) for the U.K., Reynolds (1995) for the U.S. and
Alion (1991a,b) for France. Unfortunately, the three sources give very different
views on box office numbers. For the U.K., we were able to retrieve only the titles
of the ten top movies for every year (210 movies); for the U.S., the list included
over 3,000 movies; for France, the only consistent list (there exist other lists, but
these are marred with inconsistencies) that we could find included the top 75 box
offices for movies produced between 1956 and 1970. We eventually opted for the
following choice: since there were no attendance numbers available for the U.K.,
we only introduced information as to whether the movie was listed or not in the
box office list. Among the 249 movies selected above, 69 were in the U.K. list of
210 box office movies, 74 in the top 210 list for the U.S., and 15 in the top 75
list for France. This introduced an unavoidable asymmetry on box office statistics;
the information which is provided by aggregate box office numbers should thus be
taken with some care.
(b) TV broadcasts. We also computed the number of times each movie was
shown on the following (freely accessible) TV-channels over the years 1989, 1990
and 1992 to 199412:
ON THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF MOVIES 281
− Belgium (French speaking channels): RTB (public) and RTB2-Télé 21 (pub￾lic), RTL (private).
− Belgium (Dutch speaking channels): TV1 (public), TV2 (public), VTM
(private).
− France: Antenne 2 (France 2 since 1992) (public), France 3 (public), TF1
(private).
− Germany: ARD (public), ZDF (public).
− Netherlands: NL1 (public), NL2 (public), NL3 (public).
− United Kingdom: BBC1 (public), BBC2 (public).
− France and Germany: ARTE (public).
(c) Ratings by experts. Finally, we included quality (number of stars) given in two
well-known movie guides, Maltin (1997) and Tulard (1997). Maltin is American
while Tulard is French, but, of course, they both discuss and rate “foreign” movies.
Maltin attributes 0 (actually, this is what he qualifies as BOMB), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
3.5 or 4 stars. Tulard’s classification is somewhat more coarse; he awards 0, 1,
2, 3 or 4 stars. Note that it was not always possible to retrieve this information
for the following reasons: (a) some movies are simply not included in the guides;
(b) Maltin’s guide only gives the title under which the movie was shown in the
U.S. and, sometimes, we could not find Maltin’s rating if only the original title (in
Japanese, Indian, Swedish, French, etc.) was available.
Notes
?
We thank O. Ashenfelter and C. Croux for discussions on quality in art, wines, and nonpara￾metric statistics, as well as Pascal Courty, Marie-Paule Orban, Ruth Towse and an anonymous
referee for comments on previous versions, and for references. We are also grateful to Ms.
Corbisier from Télé-Moustique, Brussels, M. Covents, Centre de Documentation Catholique,
Brussels, J.P. Dorchain, Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique, Brussels, R. Laudrin, Centre Na￾tional de la Cinématographie, Paris, for their help in retrieving information and data. The
paper was presented at the Tenth Conference on Cultural Economics in Barcelona, June
1998. Financial support from the Belgian Government under contract PAI P4/01 is gratefully
acknowledged.

2. See, however, the very controversial, but historically important, analysis by de Piles (1708).
3. See also the interesting paper by Cameron (1995) on the “theoretical” role of art critics.
4. According to the Centre National de la Cinématographie in Paris, no such list exists for France.
5. It would have been more meaningful to add audiences, but these were available for the U.S. and
France only, and not for the U.K.
6. This reduces the number of unrated movies to a total of 7 out of 249. Note that even 7 is a
surprisingly large number, since each movie in our data comes either from a “best movies” list
or was attributed an award.
7. For France and the U.K., available data allow for one comparison only.

10. According to the Centre National de la Cinématographie in Paris, no such list exists for France.
11. 110 movies received five votes or more, and only 81 received six or more votes; this forced us
to select among 110 and not among 100 titles.
12. The year 1991 is missing, since the original data were not available in a convenient form.
