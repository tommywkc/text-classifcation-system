Abstract
I investigated the number and locations of characters as they appear on the screen in 48 popular
movies released from 1935 to 2010. Sampling an average of one of every 500 frames (∼20 s of film)
I amassed data from almost 14 000 movie images. The number and placement of the characters in
each image were digitally recorded and compared across years and across aspect ratios (the ratio
of the width to the height of the image). Results show a roughly linear decrease in the number of
characters on the screen across years. Moreover, the number of characters influences shot scale, shot
duration, and mediates their direct effect on one another. The location of characters on the screen was
measured by the bridge of the nose between the eyes. By this measure I found that framing varies
widely across aspect ratios, but when each image is conformed to the same shape, the overlap of the
locations of characters is remarkably constant across years and aspect ratios for images with one, two,
and three characters. Together, these results exemplify both constancy and change in the evolution of
popular movies.

1. Film Theory, Hollywood Style, and Historical Change
In his discussion of film form, Eisenstein (1949, pp. 15–16) distinguished be￾tween the mise-en-scène and the mise-en-cadre. Both are concepts important
for film theory. Mise-en-scène means, literally, ‘placed on the stage’ but it
has come to mean the three-dimensional arrangement and consideration of
everything that happens in front of the camera. Bordwell (2005), for exam￾ple, focused on the logic of the staging of characters in this three dimensional
space. Mise-en-cadre means ‘placed in the frame’ and the logic of the num-

ber and the placement of characters within the two-dimensional extent of the
cinematographic image is the domain that I study here. But to what end?
A central focus of cognitive film theory concerns how popular movies are
structured to convey their narratives to viewers (see, for example, Bordwell,
1989; Currie, 1995). This approach to movies opens up many possibilities.
One is that to study the general structure of movies is simultaneously to study
the predispositions of the mind — its perception, cognition, and affect. My stu￾dents and I have embraced this stance and, more particularly, we have assumed
that the study of changes in film over the last century can reveal many facets
of popular movie structure — called Hollywood style — that have evolved
to fit better what our minds can easily process. This article continues this re￾search tack, but here I more deliberately borrow a tenet from Bordwell et al.
(1985; Bordwell, 2006). That is, although it is undeniable that popular movies
are evolving in certain aspects of their style, it is equally undeniable that other
aspects are rock solid and unchanging.
Consider first some of the changes. In many cases the content of older
movies may seem dated. Frequently they are adaptations of now-seldom-read
novels or of theatrical productions, a genre that no longer excites a wide swath
of popular culture. Moreover, older movies occasionally present an unflinch￾ing and embarrassing slice of our cultural past — colonialism, racism, sexism,
and the denigration of the foreign and the weak. Less offensively, clothing and
hairstyles and the incessant smoking of cigarettes may strike us as anachro￾nistic. But these attributes are not in the domain of my inquiry. Instead, I am
interested in one aspect of the change in the physical appearance of movies.
Of course, old movies are often in black and white; they can be grainy; their
sound quality is beneath today’s standards; they are often framed narrowly in
the Academy aspect ratio (4:3 or 1.37) like old-style television or blown out of
scale and distorted with the original CinemaScope (2.55; see Cutting, 2014b);
and they often have longer duration shots than contemporary viewers are ac￾customed to (Cutting et al., 2011b, c; Salt, 2006). One also finds fades and
dissolves interleaved between scenes to a degree that no modern filmmaker
would dare emulate (Cutting et al., 2011a); and major characters often walk
in and out of scenes, which contemporary movies rarely replicate (Cutting,
2014a).
Although popular movies have changed dramatically over the last 75 years,
in many ways they have hardly changed at all. The popular genres are roughly
the same, the narrative form is roughly the same, and many aspects of the
studio-era Hollywood style are still with us. Many stylistic attributes that
worked well in older movies — shot/reverse shot organization in dialogs,
point-of-view editing (where a character looks off screen and the movie cuts
to what that character is looking at), and continuity editing (emphasizing the
logical coherence of the succession of shots) — are essentially the same now Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

as they were years ago. Moreover, the arc-like structure of scenes has not
changed (Cutting et al., 2012); scenes generally begin and end with longer
duration shots and tend to begin with a longer scale shot and then move in on
the action.
This article is about examples of both stasis and change in movies. In par￾ticular, although the normalized placement of characters within the image has
hardly changed at all, the number of those characters has diminished markedly
with time. The shots of these movies simultaneously present more characters
and, as I will demonstrate, this has consequences for other aspects of film
form.
2. Methods for Registering the Number and Location of Characters
How might the placement and enumeration of characters be sampled and mea￾sured? To begin, I selected 48 English-language movies. Three were chosen
from each of 18 years in release intervals of five years from 1935 to 2010.
Within each release year one movie was classified on the Internet Movie
Database (IMDb, http://www.imdb.com) as a drama (sometimes also a ro￾mance), one as a comedy (sometimes also a romantic comedy), and one as
an action film (sometimes a war movie or a thriller). Each was among the
highest grossing movies of its release year, or has been seen by the most peo￾ple reporting on the IMDb. This group was culled from a larger sample of 160
movies that my students and I have explored previously (Cutting et al., 2010;
Cutting et al., 2011b). The 48 movies are listed in the Appendix.
The movies were extracted from commercially available DVDs and dis￾played on a laptop or desktop computer. I wrote a computer interface that
skipped through each movie, beginning to end, by a uniformly random num￾ber of frames bounded between 400 and 600. Thus, on average three were
selected from every 1500 frames (∼1 min of film at 24 frames/s). In this man￾ner between 247 (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, 1995) and 508 (Spartacus,
1960) frames were sampled per movie, for a total of 16 063 images.
Because I was interested in the relations among shot duration and the other
variables, I then removed frames that were from the same shot, leaving a total
of 13 956 sampled frames, of which a small number had missing data. The
reason for omitting these samples is that shots that lasted more than about 20 s
might have two frames that represented them, those of 40 s might have three,
and so forth. Without their removal the results would be slightly biased in the
representation of long-duration shots.
The mouse-controlled interface presented a single frame, allowing me first
to count the number of people shown — 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ (five or more) — and
to register that number by moving crosshairs to the upper left corner of the im￾age and clicking on the appropriate numeral there. The interface then allowed Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

Figure 1. Examples of the interface and responses for frames in three movies in the most
common aspect ratios — 1.37, 1.85, and 2.35. The top panel shows Clarence Doolittle (Frank
Sinatra) in Anchors Aweigh (1945, from DVD, Warner Home Video); the middle panel shows
Kate McCallister (Catherine O’Hara) in Home Alone (1990, from DVD, Twentieth Century Fox
Home Entertainment); and the bottom panel shows Joseph Turner (Robert Redford) in Three
Days of the Condor (1975, from DVD, Paramount Home Video). The crosshair at the nose of
the bridge of each character mimics the crosshair used in the computer interface to locate the
position of each character in the frame. In the upper left corner of each still are small red nu￾merals that served as buttons to click on when the number of characters in the image had been
determined, which was followed (left to right) by clicks that located each character (up to five)

me to move the crosshairs again and click on each of one to five characters
in the image, left to right. For pragmatic reasons I will consider here only
the locations of up to three characters. To register their location, I moved the
crosshairs to the bridge of the nose just between the eyes. I chose this position
because it is generally the center of gravity of fixations for viewers watch￾ing single-character shots (one-shots) in movies (Smith, 2013). Examples are
shown in Fig. 1.
Obviously with long and medium scale shots the exact positioning of the
cross hairs on the face would hardly make any difference. Considering 2.35
films and the arrangement of seats in movie theaters, THX certification (THX,
2014) would demand that image heights should be 20° from the middle of the Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

theater. This means that for a typical long shot the height of a character’s head
is about 2°, a bit more than the width of one’s thumb at arm’s length, with the
difference between the eyes and the mouth a bit less than 1°. With close-ups,
on the other hand, such crosshair positioning might matter, since mouths are
fixated about one third of the time (Võ et al., 2012).
The data on the distribution of various shot scales in this sample show that
8% of these frames are extreme long shots (1 = XLS, with the environment
shown well beyond the head and feet of the characters), 14% long shots (2 =
LS, barely encompassing the head and feet), 24% medium long shots (3 =
MLS, showing the characters roughly from the knees or mid thigh up), 30%
medium shots (4 = MS, waist or stomach up), 16% medium close-ups (5 =
MCU, upper chest, shoulders and head), 6% close-ups (6 = CU, head alone),
and 1% extreme close-ups (7 = XCU, only part of the head fitting the screen).
Only in the latter three categories is the face large enough so that fixation
patterns away from the eyes might be reliably registered. For a medium close￾up the head is about 8° in height with the difference between the mouth and
eyes about 3°. These, the close-ups, and the extreme close-ups would show
some mean fixation positions below the bridge of the nose, but perhaps only
one third of the time for shots of these three scales (or ∼7% of all frames).
A more detailed analysis of fixation and shot scale is given in Section 5.
For this investigation, however, I was interested in the locations of charac￾ters regardless of how they faced with respect to the camera. When a character
is turned away, I estimated the position of the bridge of their nose and clicked
there. When all (up to five) characters were located, the horizontal and verti￾cal coordinates were recorded for each character in the image along with the
frame number. When no character appeared in the image, I could click any￾where other than over the numerals and the frame number but no coordinates
were then stored. The next frame was then sampled, presented, and the proce￾dure repeated through to the end of the movie.
I took care to insure that the characters that were registered were ones that
focused on the action in the scene; those in the background and not focused
on the action were ignored. Thus, for example, many shots in Inherit the Wind
(1960) present a packed courtroom in the background with all individuals ob￾serving the interrogation of every witness. When shown in this manner, many
more than five characters are available to be counted in the frame. However,
when the court adjourns these characters begin to mill around and the camera
focuses on a few characters at the front of the courtroom. Since the observers
were no longer focused on the concerns presented in the image, they were then
ignored and only those directly in front of the camera engaged in conversation
were counted.
Similarly, for scenes in restaurants (All About Eve, 1950; Valentine’s Day,
2010) I did not count the diners in the background unless they turned to look Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

and listen to a conversation at the focal table; or in a nightclub (Goodfellas,
1990; Ocean’s Eleven, 1960) unless everyone turned to look at a performer;
or at a horserace unless everyone was focused on the race, the betting, or the
action at hand (Mission: Impossible II, 2000). For military maneuvers (Santa
Fe Trail, 1940; Battle Cry, 1955; Spartacus, 1960; The Empire Strikes Back,
1980; The Revenge of the Sith, 2005), whether soldiers were in formation or
assaulting an enemy, all characters typically have a single focus and I counted
them (up to five). I counted people, animated characters (Anchors Aweigh,
1945; Nine to Five, 1980), genetically altered primates (Beneath the Planet of
the Apes, 1970), extraterrestrials, cyborgs, and robots (the Star Wars movies)
participating in the narrative. I also counted characters whether they were in
sharp focus or not, so long as it was easy to determine that their head was in
the frame and that they were focused on the gist of what was going on.
Two types of data are of interest. The first is the mean number of characters
in the images, and the second is the location of the characters within the frame,
taking into account the changes is aspect ratios — the image width divided by
its height — from 1.37 (12 movies), 1.66 (2 movies), 1.85 (9 movies), 2.2 (1
movie), 2.35 (21 movies), to 2.55 (3 movies).
3. The Number of Characters per Frame
The full regression model predicts the number of characters in images from
five independent variables. Three concern each of the 48 movies as a whole
(release year, aspect ratio, and genre) and two concern the shot within which
the frame was sampled (shot duration and shot scale). All five independent
variables were statistically significant (ps < 0.001). The stepwise potency of
these variables, along with their standardized beta weights, from strongest to
weakest are: release year [7.75% of the variance accounted for, β (beta) = −0.25], shot scale (+3.53%, β = −0.19), aspect ratio (+0.19%, β = 0.06),
shot duration (+0.15%, β = 0.04), and genre (+0.09%, β = 0.03). For the
whole model the adjusted R2 = 0.117 [F(6, 13 928) = 557, p < 0.0001, with
df = 2 for genre and df = 1 for year, aspect, duration, and scale]. I discuss the
effects on characters of release year in this section, the effects of characters on
shot duration and shot scale in Section 4, the effects of shot scale in Sections 4
and 5, and the effects of aspect ratio in Sections 4 and 6.
Consider two ways of thinking about the characters in an image — their
mean number and their distribution. The left-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows a
scatterplot of the mean number of characters per image in each of the 48
movies by release year. Note the strong, essentially linear decline (r = −0.72,
t(46) = 6.98, p < 0.0001, Cohen’s d = 2.06). Remember, all images with five
or more characters were truncated to a value of five; some images (although
not very many) might have hundreds, even thousands, of visible individuals Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

Figure 2. The left-hand panel shows the mean number of characters per frame per movie plotted
by release year. The right-hand panel shows the distribution of characters in the images of 24
older movies (1935–1970) and 24 newer movies (1975–2010). The whiskers at the right of each

focusing on the action in a particular shot. Notice that the images of movies
from 1935 to 1950 average about 2.5 characters, whereas the those from 1995
to 2010 average only about 1.5 characters, with some contemporary movies
yielding an average near a single character per frame across the entire movie.
A more detailed understanding of this change can be seen in a plot of the
distributions of characters for two groups of movies — the mean proportions
of the 24 movies from 1935 to 1970 and those of the 24 movies from 1975 to
2010. These differences are shown in right-hand panel of Fig. 2. The functions
differ reliably at every point — 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ characters [ts(46) > |3.26|, ps < 0.002, ds > 0.42], with greater proportions for the older movies at 2, 3, 4,
and 5+ characters. Notice also that the older movies also have proportionately
fewer situations in which there is one or no character. The modal number from
older movies is two characters per frame along with quite a lot of frames in
the 5+ category. In contrast the modal number for the newer movies is one
character per frame, and with not only less than half in the 5+ category but also
twice as many (14%) in the category where no character’s head appears. This
latter kind of image is particularly common in action movies where inserts
(close-ups of details that the filmmakers want to make sure viewers notice)
show characters’ hands on gadgets or guns, clocks ticking down, or computer
screens with moving cursors or typed-in messages, or closing long shots show
vehicles of all kinds speeding off. Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

4. Characters, Shot Scale, and Shot Duration
What does this numerical change in character presentation add to what we
know about changes in film form and Hollywood style? Three variables inter￾act in this context — shot duration, shot scale, and the number of characters in
the frame. We know that shot durations have gotten shorter over the course of
this sample, 1935 to 2010 (Cutting et al., 2010; Salt, 2006) and that shot scales
have shifted more towards close-ups (Cutting et al., 2012; Cutting and Iricin￾schi, 2014; Salt, 2006). Moreover, relying on the statements of filmmakers,
Bordwell (2006, p. 137) suggested a link between these two: “Tighter fram￾ings permit faster cutting”. One would suppose that fewer characters would
also allow tighter framings and, perhaps in turn, shorter duration shots. How
closely related are all of these variables?
Results are represented in the panels of Fig. 3. The vertically elongated gray
clouds of varying density in both panels are representations of the raw data —
the darker the area the more data points are represented. The darkest corre￾spond to those shots with reaction time regions at the 80th percentile density
and higher. Intermediate gray areas correspond to the data between 60th and
80th, the 40th and 60th, and the 20th and 40th percentiles. White areas are those
below the 20th percentile.
The left-hand panel shows an upwardly sloping regression line that repre￾sents how shot duration increases with the increasing number of characters
that appear in the frame [t(13 929) = 9.16, p < 0.0001, Cohen’s d = 0.16].
Figure 3. The left-hand panel shows a representation of the effects of the number of characters
depicted in a shot and the increasing duration of that shot. The upward sloping regression line
shows this effect to be about 1.5 s per character. The right-hand panel shows the effect of shot
scale and the decreasing shot duration. The narrow vertical clouds in both panels represent the
distributions of raw data where darker regions represent more data points and lighter regions
fewer data points. XLS = extreme long shot, LS = long shot, MLS = medium long shot, MS =

The plot suggests that each additional character that appears typically neces￾sitates an additional 1.5 s per shot. Consistent with this finding, the shortest
duration shots are generally those with no characters. For the various kinds of
close-ups these are often inserts (for example, shots of hands on objects), and
for the various kinds of longer shots these range from panoramas of mountains
to unpopulated street scenes to empty rooms to vacant desks. Unsurprisingly,
the images that are most frequent are with those one (36%) and two characters
(30%) characters.
In the right-hand panel the downwardly sloping regression line represents
the decrease in shot duration as shot scale increases, moving towards close￾ups (t = −6.27, p < 0.0001, d = 0.011). Thus, generally speaking, tighter
framing yields shorter duration shots as Bordwell suggested. Again, medium
long (3; here 23%) and medium shots (4; 30%) are the most common. Close￾ups (6) and extreme close-ups (7) are combined since they are rare.
Logically, these three variables are ordered in film production. The direc￾tor stages the mise-en-scène with the characters to be seen in the shots, the
cinematographer frames the scale for the mise-en-cadre, and the editor cuts
and assembles the shots. One can statistically assess the relation among the
three variables by a mediation analysis (Baron and Kenney, 1986), looking
for causal relations that may follow the logical ones. How this analysis is
performed is suggested in Fig. 4. The associations (regression coefficients)
among the three variables are assessed. Each of these is relatively small (they
can range from 0.0 to 1.0) but statistically significant given the very large sam￾ple. Of critical importance here is the association between shot scale and shot
duration (−0.045). When one takes into account the number of characters in
the frame this association decreases (−0.033) very strongly as measured by a
Sobel test (z = 17.7; Preacher and Hayes, 2004). This means that the number

in the frame. That is, the effect of shot scale on shot duration (closer shots are linked to shorter
duration shots; Bordwell, 2006, p. 137) is significantly affected (mediated) by the number of
characters in the frame. In other words, the more characters the longer the shot scale, and in
turn the longer the shot scale the longer the shot duration. Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

of characters is not only statistically related to shot duration and shot scale,
but one can say that it causally affects the relationship between them.
There are other important effects not shown in Fig. 3. These include a strong
decline of shot duration with release year (t = −31.42, p < 0.0001, d = 0.53),
probably the most widely known and researched historical change in popular
movies. This effect predicts shot duration, while not diminishing the effect
of the number of characters (t = 5.02, p < 0.001, d = 0.09) or shot scale
(t = −2.92, p < 0.001, d = 0.05) on shot duration. It is tempting then, given
the results shown in Figs 3 and 4, to think that a good bit of this release-year
effect is due to the effects studied here — the decreasing number characters
per shot and the increasing shot scale. In fact, however, they are only a small
part of the story. Stepwise multiple regression analysis allows one to assess
the relative magnitude of these effects. If one enters the number of characters
and the shot scale into the analysis of shot duration first, one finds that they
account for 4.4% of the variance. If one then enters release year, it accounts for
an additional 9.4% of the variance. Because these effects are correlated, if one
does the reverse, entering release year first, one find that it accounts for 12.9%
of the variance, and together the number of characters and shot scale account
for only an additional 0.9% variance. Thus, much more is going on with the
decline of shot durations than the variables studied here. Roughly speaking,
perhaps only about a fifth of the decline in shot duration can be accounted for
by the decline in the number of characters shown in a frame.
Finally, there is also a reliable effect of aspect ratio (t = −17.48, p <
0.0001, d = 0.29) although the direction of this simple trend is somewhat
counterintuitive — the wider (and hence larger) the screen the fewer the num￾ber of characters is presented. Movies in Academy ratio (aspect = 1.37) have
more people in them than those in widescreen (1.85), which have more than
those in CinemaScope (2.35). The reason for this is its combination with two
other trends: First, the number of characters per image has declined with re￾lease year and all movies released prior to 1953 were in the Academy ratio;
and second, more contemporary action films, which show fewer characters
per image — 1.91 vs. 2.01 for comedies and dramas (t = 4.81, p < 0.008,
d = 0.08) — tend to be formatted in 2.35 whereas comedies and dramas in
this sample are often formatted in 1.85 (see Cutting, 2014a, b). When genre
and release year are factored out there is a smaller and positive relationship
between aspect ratio and the number of characters — the wider the image the
more characters within the frame (t = 5.89, p < 0.0001, d = 0.10).
5. One-Shots, Shot Scale, and Attentional Synchrony

gaze. That is, with one character in view there are fewer choices of where
to look than if there are two or more. But shot scale and the further con￾sideration of one-shots can provide additional support for this view. Hasson
et al. (2008) showed considerable correlation in gaze position for viewers
of film, and Smith and Mital (2013) showed that this attentional synchrony
(shared positions of eye fixation) are considerably greater than anything seen
for static pictures. Combining one-shots with the consideration of shot scale
offers a further opportunity to investigate attentional synchrony, and Smith
(2013) measured eye fixations on characters in shots of different scale. Smith
found that the variance in eye fixation positions was least for medium close￾ups and that this variance increased as filmmakers moved to longer shots (eye
gaze went to other parts of the body) and when they moved to close-ups (eye
gaze dodged between eyes and mouth, which were enlarged for these shots).
Although I have no eye movement data here, it is useful to compare the eye￾position covariance data taken from Smith (2013), shown in the right-hand
panel of Fig. 5, with the distributional one-shot scale data for the samples
of frames in the 48 films studied here, shown in the left-hand panel. It is
also useful to compare the older films with the more contemporary ones. The
correlation of the compactness of eye fixations from Smith (2013) with the
one-shot scale proportions for films from 1935 to 1970 is quite high (r = 0.88,

p < 0.009, t(5) = 4.14, d = 3.71), but that for the films from 1975 to 2010
is a bit higher (r = 0.95, p < 0.001, t(5) = 7.66, d = 7.66). These latter dis￾tributions differ significantly (t(13 933) = 198, p < 0.0001, d = 2.17), and it
would appear that filmmakers may be, among many other things, tailoring the
distributions of their shot scales in line with their desire to control viewer gaze.
Let me now shift gears from gradual historical changes in Hollywood style to
a robust constancy.
6. The Location of Characters Within the Frame
Given the characters on the screen — the mise-en-cadre — where are they
located? Are they in different locations depending on the aspect ratio of the
movie? Perhaps the best way to approach these questions is graphically, so
the spatial distributions for the frames with single characters (called one￾shots) are shown in left-hand panels of Fig. 6. The three panels there show
scaled replicas of screens with aspect ratios of 1.37 (12 movies with 928
examples), 1.85 (9 movies, 1139 examples), and 2.35 (21 movies, 2777 ex￾amples). The coarsely concentric blobs represent quintiles of spatial density,
two-dimensional versions of the same kind of plots seen in Fig. 3. Again, the
darkest represent smoothed areas that have spatial densities of characters in
Figure 6. The distributions of locations for one-, two-, and three-character shots normalized to
the image frame of a 1.37 aspect ratio in movies with aspect ratios of 1.37 (12 movies), 1.85
(9 movies), and 2.35 (21 movies). Displays represent smoothed areas of character positions
divided by the 80th, 60th, 40th, 20th percentiles of density. That is, the darkest areas have occur￾rences of individual characters whose density across all single-character images is greater than
the 80th percentile, and the lightest areas have occurrences whose density is less than the 20th
percentile. Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

the 80th percentile and higher; the lightest areas covering most of the surround
represent those locations in the 20th percentile and lower, and intermediate
gray areas in between. The most obvious and visible result is that as the movie
image gets wider, the locations in which single characters appear spreads out
accordingly. One can assess this effect by measuring the distances of all one￾shot characters in all formats from the center of the screen. Indeed, as the
screen gets wider the locations of the characters spread laterally away from
the center [t(5380) = 46.64, p < 0.0001, d = 1.27].
However, notice also that the lateral spread appears proportional to the as￾pect ratio of the screen. If one morphs the screens to the same shape (an affine
transformation represented in the top panel of Fig. 7 as a 1.37 format screen)
the distributions of all the percentile regions become congruent. Indeed, after
this adjustment the variation in proportional distances of characters from the
center of the screen across all aspect ratios disappears (t = 0.07, ns). Null hy￾pothesis testing does not allow for assessment of the plausibility of finding no
statistical effect, but Bayesian analysis does (Rouder et al., 2009). When the
effect of release year is assessed after genre and aspect ratios are partialed out,
the results show that the null hypothesis is slightly favored over the plausibil￾ity of an effect of release year. The ratio of the evidence for the null over the
evidence for a change over release years, called the Bayes factor, is 1.07. Thus,
despite the differences in screen shapes across the 75 years, there has been a
remarkable constancy in the proportional placement of single characters on
the screen.
The same type of general patterns can be seen with two characters, in fram￾ings called two-shots. These are shown for different aspect ratios in right-hand
panels of Fig. 6, and with the morphed similarities in the middle panel of
Fig. 7. The average distance of the two characters from the center of the screen
grows with the aspect ratio, as suggested in the right-hand panels of Fig. 6
[t(5212) = 32.77, p < 0.0001, d = 0.46]; yet the normalized distance in the
morphed comparisons shown in Fig. 7 is greatly reduced in the context of
so many examples (t = −3.27, p < 0.001, d = 0.09, Bayes factor = 0.35).
In fact, the mean positions of the two characters in the normalized space are
proportionately slightly closer together on wider screens. Since lateral extents
of the screens vary it will be useful to measure such displacements in terms
of the vertical extent of the screen, which can be taken as constant across all
aspect ratios. Thus, the two-shot difference in mean normalized character po￾sitions between 1.37 and 2.55 formats is, measured laterally, about 1% of the
screen height — statistically reliable but almost negligible. Moreover, like that
for one-shots, the residual effect here cannot be attributed to variations over
release years; Bayesian analysis greatly favors the null hypothesis (Bayes fac￾tor = 11.3). Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

Figure 7. The distributions of locations for one-, two-, and three-character shots normalized
(affine transformed) to the image frame of a 1.37 aspect ratio. The grid of lines divides the area
into thirds, both horizontally and vertically following the putative ‘rule of thirds’. I regard the
correspondence of the grid lines to the two-shot case to be happenstantial.
The distributions of characters continue these trends for three-shots, al￾though they become noisier as suggested in the normalized graph at the bot￾tom of Fig. 7. The mean position of the central figure in the three-shot is
roughly the mean position of the single character in the one-shot. The flanking
two characters are displaced more laterally than the characters in the two￾shot. Moreover, the spread of the flanking characters increases with aspect
ratio [t(1418) = 24.9, p < 0.0001, d = 1.32] as before, but when normal￾ized the differences across aspect ratios are minimized (t = −2.73, p < 0.006, Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

d = 0.14, Bayes factor = 0.91). As with the characters in the normalized two￾shots, the mean position of flanking characters in the three-shots are pinched
together a bit more in wider screen shots, even a bit more than they are in
two-shots. The lateral difference between the flanking characters in the 1.37
and 2.55 formats is about 2% of the screen height. Moreover and again, a
Bayesian analysis favors the null hypothesis over any effect of release years
(Bayes factor = 6.33).
7. Asymmetries and a Rule of Thirds?
There are also asymmetries in the image results seen in Figs 6 and 7. All
of these have displacements slightly to the left of center of the screen. For
one-shots, this lateral displacement is about 2% of screen height [t(5381) = 9.97, p < 0.0001, d = 0.27]. For two-shots, this leftward displacement of both
characters is about 1% of the screen height [t(5216) = 4.23, p < 0.0001, d = 0.12]. And for the characters in the three-shots they are all displaced to the left
by almost 3% of the screen height [t(1418) = 3.83, p < 0.0001, d = 0.20].
It is somewhat difficult to know how to account for such effects. Are these
results real or an artifact? It is often said that many actors have a preference for
which side of their face is photographed; web searches suggest that Claudette
Colbert strongly preferred that the left side of her face be photographed but
that Mariah Carey prefers her right. Blackburn and Schirillo (2012) have
shown that three-quarter views of left sides of peoples’ faces, in both nor￾mal and mirror-reversed presentations, are judged as more attractive than the
right sides — but the effect size is relatively small and the number of pictures
used was relatively few. Were this effect real, the logic of the placement of
characters’ heads more towards the right side of the screen would place their
noses more to the left. Nonetheless, the data for all of this seems weak and
the logic of staging characters in such a manner seems tenuous when applied
to different places on the screen. Most characters cannot be facing screen left
most of the time.
More likely, this slight leftward bias could be an undershoot response of
mine in performing the task, moving the mouse cursor left to right from the
upper left of the image where the numerals are located to indicate the number
of characters in the image to the bridge of the nose for each of the characters.
Results concerning Fitts’ Law for lateral movement accuracies often find such
an undershoot when moving from a start position to a target manually (Engel￾brecht et al., 2003) or even with saccadic eye movements (Wu et al., 2010).
Fortunately, even if such a bias accounts for the asymmetries, it matters little
for the overall patterns shown in Figs 6 and 7. Moreover, it would not be ap￾plicable to the vertical dimension, nor would it affect the number of characters
recorded per frame shown in Fig. 2. Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

Finally, grid lines are placed in the morphed 1.37-format images of Fig. 7.
These represent what is called the ‘rule of thirds’ concerning the composition
of images in photography and in film. That is, the horizontal and vertical ex￾tents of the image are divided into thirds and the cross hatchings create nine
equal areas. The intersections of the lines are often thought to be good com￾position points. That is, placing objects there is thought to provide a good
dynamic balance. This idea seems to have originated with John Thomas Smith
(1797, pp. 15–17) and has been promoted in some books on art, photography,
and cinematography (see Bergeron and Lopes, 2012, p. 71; Ryan and Lenos,
2012, p. 40; Thompson and Bowen, 2013, pp. 43–44).
Consider horizontal and vertical dimensions of this ‘rule’. For a two-shot
and moving from the left edge of the frame to the right edge, the modal hor￾izontal placement of the characters’ heads at one-third and two-thirds across
the image would seem almost automatic. Each head would normally be sur￾rounded by a certain amount of social distance (as in conversation, but not as
in kissing) and, regardless of shot scale, the composition of the shot would
likely bring the heads towards the center and away from the edges. The modal
vertical placements would follow. Each head needs space above it (called
headroom; Thompson and Bowen, 2013) moving the eyes downward from
the top and much of the body is typically included, moving the eye up from
the center.
But rather than impressionistically considering this rule, one can address
the issue statistically. Shown in Fig. 8 is a mock-up of a 1.37 screen image,
with ellipses drawn around the intersections of the lines that delimit one cri￾terion for assessing the rule of thirds. The radial axes of the ellipses are 11%
of the screen dimensions. In this context it seems reasonable to consider only
the upper two ellipses for the placement of the bridge of the characters’ noses.
At issue is: what proportion of the bridges of the noses of the characters ap￾pears within these ellipses? Whereas these particular ellipses occupy 17% of

the upper half of the screen, 41% of the characters’ faces appear within them.
This effect is highly reliable [χ2(1) = 4558, p < 0.0001], but the fact that
59% of the characters fall outside of this region makes any assumption of a
corroboration of the ‘rule of thirds’ seem less impressive. Moreover, consid￾ering the one-shots, the characters appear within the ellipses only 19% of the
time, and in the three-shots they appear within them only 30% of the shots. It
seems to me that these data are not strong evidence in favor a ‘rule of thirds’
as applied to the framing of characters in popular movies. Moreover, others
have questioned the empirical efficacy of this rule in photography (see Guidi
and Palmer, 2014; Palmer et al., 2014). My conclusion, then, is that because
the one-shot and the three-shot distributions bear little resemblance to the in￾tersections in Fig. 7, the correspondence of characters positions and the grid
lines for two-shots — one out of three cases shown in Fig. 7 — is essentially
happenstance. The two-shot pattern seems to follow from the symmetries of
frame by character number interactions.
8. Discussion and Summary
Although he did not do so quantitatively, Bordwell (2005) studied the spatial
distribution of characters in the mise-en-scène, the area in front of the cam￾era. This quantitative study explored the number and distribution of characters
in the mise-en-cadre, in the frame of the image. Bordwell et al. (1985) and
Bordwell (2006) explored the history of the development of Hollywood style,
emphasizing both its constancy and change from the silent era through the
studio and post-studio eras to the present day. In exploring the number and
locations of characters in frames taken from 48 movies, I found one of each.
First, the average number of characters shown in shots of older movies is
more than that for more contemporary ones, and the change from means of
about 2.5 to about 1.5 characters appears to have been smooth and incremen￾tal. But second, the proportional placement of characters within the frame
has, despite changes in aspect ratio, remained remarkably constant over the
same period. In shots where one, two, and three characters are portrayed and
then morphed to the same aspect ratio, I found vanishingly little difference,
whether the frame is in Academy ratio (1.37) or CinemaScope (2.35). These
results, one of change and the other of constancy, suggest that popular cinema
is evolving but not in all attributes.
Why might one of these variables change (the number of characters in the
frame) and the other one not (the placement of the characters in that frame)?
The answer to the latter would appear to be that there are few good options.
Note that, although there is great variation in where one, two, and three char￾acters might appear on the screen as shown in Fig. 7, the center of the screen
is a compositionally prominent spot (Arnheim, 1982; Guidi and Palmer, 2014) Downloaded from Brill.com 03/04/2024 01:08:06PM

and viewers have a bias to look there (Mital et al., 2011; Tatler, 2007). It is
not clear whether this bias comes from our experience looking at movies, or
whether movies capitalize on the symmetries around the center of the frame
and force us to look there — chicken and egg. But either way, working from
the center out, whether as a filmmaker or as a viewer, seems to be a fine nor￾mative strategy. Thus, for a single character or the central character of three,
the center of the frame will be the location of central tendency. For two char￾acters, or for the flanking characters in the threesome, they need to be spread
out. But if they are too far from the center, constraints of saccade length and
accuracy may impair viewers’ quick apprehension of the action; but they also
cannot be too close if they are to keep personal or social distance.
Why would the number of characters on the screen decline? The answer to
this question, I think, is threefold. The first rationale stems from filmmakers’
increasing control of viewers’ gaze (Smith, 2013). Viewers look at the faces of
characters in movies almost all the time; they rarely look at backgrounds. By
presenting fewer characters per image, filmmakers give viewers fewer options
as to where to look. Second, reducing the number of characters in frame allows
filmmakers to hone in on one in particular, increasingly using close-ups of
various kinds. And third, as noted by Bordwell (2006) and shown in Fig. 3,
closer shots allow quicker cutting. The latter two trends — more close-ups
and shorter duration shots — are attributes of what Bordwell (2006) has called
the intensified continuity found in contemporary movies. I claim that the first
trend — fewer characters in the frame — is a precondition for the latter two,
and the mediation analysis provides support for this view.
