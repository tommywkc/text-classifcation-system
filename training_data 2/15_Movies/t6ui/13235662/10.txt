The authors investigated the association between exposure to smoking in movies and
the initiation and progression of adolescent smoking over time among 6,522 U.S.
adolescents (between the ages of 10 and 14 years, at baseline) in a nationally rep￾resentative, 4-wave random-digit-dial telephone survey. They conducted a hazard
(survival) analysis testing whether exposure to movie smoking and demographic,
personality, social, and structural factors predict (a) earlier smoking onset and
(b) faster transition to experimental (1–99 cigarettes=lifetime) and established
smoking (>100 cigarettes=lifetime). Results suggest that higher exposure to movie
smoking is associated with less time to trying cigarettes for the first time (adjusted
hazard ratio ¼ 1.66; 95% CI [1.37, 2.01]) but not with faster escalation of smoking
behavior following initiation (adjusted hazard ratio ¼ 1.53; 95% CI [0.84, 2.79]).
In contrast, age, peer smoking, parenting style, and availability of cigarettes in
the home were predictors of earlier onset and faster transition to established smok￾ing. Thus, the authors concluded that the effect of exposure to mass-mediated
images of smoking in movies may decline once adolescents have started to smoke,
whereas peers and access to tobacco remain influential.
Tobacco use is a leading cause of death and ill health, and primary prevention of
smoking initiation has been an important strategy in reducing the health burden
of tobacco use (World Health Organization, 2009). Most adult smokers in the

United States started using tobacco as adolescents (U. S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2000), and an extensive body of research has identified a range of
personal and social risk factors for smoking initiation (e.g., Conrad, Flay, & Hill,
1992; Tyas & Pederson, 1998). Recently, researchers interested in mass media effects
have demonstrated a prospective relation between exposure to smoking imagery in
entertainment media and smoking onset among youth (Dalton et al., 2003; Sargent,
Gibson, & Heatherton, 2009; Sargent & Hanewinkel, 2009; Tickle, Hull, Sargent,
Dalton, & Heatherton, 2006), even after accounting for demographic, personality,
parental, and peer influences.
Youth spend a large proportion of their time consuming media (Roberts, Foehr,
& Rideout, 2005), and an extensive body of literature demonstrates prospective asso￾ciations of exposure to entertainment media with a variety of attitudinal and beha￾vioral outcomes, for example: aggression and criminality (Huesmann, Moise-Titus,
Podolski, & Eron, 2003), sexual precocity (Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, &
Berry, 2005), and alcohol use (Dal Cin et al., 2009). Given that, it is perhaps unsur￾prising that exposure to smoking in movies has been associated with smoking-related
attitudes and behavior, in both survey (e.g., Dalton et al., 2009; Dalton et al., 2003;
Distefan, Gilpin, Sargent, & Pierce, 1999; Hanewinkel, Morgenstern, Tanski, &
Sargent, 2008; Hanewinkel & Sargent, 2007; Sargent et al., 2005; Sargent et al.,
2001; Sargent et al., 2002; Sargent et al., 2009; Sargent & Hanewinkel, 2009; Sargent
et al., 2007; Thrasher, Jackson, Arillo-Santilla´n, & Sargent, 2008; Tickle et al., 2006;
Tickle, Sargent, Dalton, Beach, & Heatherton, 2001; Wills et al., 2007) and experi￾mental (Dal Cin, Gibson, Zanna, Shumate, & Fong, 2007; Gibson & Maurer, 2000;
Pechmann & Shih, 1999) research. However, the majority of research on the effects
of exposure to movie smoking on adolescents has focused on predicting initiation as
opposed to smoking maintenance or escalation. Several recent studies (Adachi-Mejia
et al., 2009; Dalton et al., 2009; Sargent et al., 2007) reveal a longitudinal association
between exposure to depictions of smoking in movies and the likelihood of becoming
an established smoker (i.e., having smoked more than 100 cigarettes). Although
these studies provide convincing evidence for the association, they are unable to dis￾tinguish effects on initiation from effects on progression. Even in studies that con￾trolled for smoking status at baseline, it is still likely that some of the established
smokers may have initiated during the study period; therefore, the effect of movie
smoking exposure on escalation of smoking, given that one has already tried,
remains unclear.
The question of whether movie smoking exposure continues to be impactful once
an adolescent has tried smoking is an important one. However, it is not entirely clear
whether one should expect that movie smoking exposure will exacerbate progression.
On the basis of the media effects literature (e.g., Bandura, 1986), exposure to smoking
models should reinforce existing smoking behavior, and therefore, exposure to movie
smoking should exert an effect on progression or escalation of smoking beyond its
effects on initiation. Survey research in Germany (Sargent & Hanewinkel, 2009)
has identified a relation between movie smoking exposure and escalation of smoking
after initiation. Further, in their experimental study of exposure to movie smoking
and smoking intentions, Dal Cin and colleagues (2007) found that identification with
a smoking character led to increased identification with smoking, and that among
smokers, this predicted intentions to continue smoking.
In contrast, Sargent and colleagues (2009) found no relation between movie
smoking exposure and progression in a regional U.S. sample. These results are
When Movies Matter 77
78 S. Dal Cin et al.
consistent with research in the area of nicotine addiction, which suggests that once
an individual has tried smoking (perhaps as little as one cigarette), the physiological
consequences of exposure to nicotine drive subsequent use (DiFranza et al., 2000;
DiFranza & Wellman, 2005). According to this perspective, once initiation has
occurred, addiction becomes the dominant predictor and escalation will happen,
independent of social influences. Furthermore, past behavior tends to be a powerful
predictor of future behavior, in particular for behaviors performed in similar con￾texts and with regular frequency (Ouellette & Wood, 1998); the consistency of beha￾vior over time suggests that once initiated, smoking behavior will be maintained, and
movie exposure will have an attenuated influence.
Given the disparate effects observed in past studies (some of which have been
limited in terms of available waves of data and the regional nature of their samples),
we aimed to undertake the present analysis in which we model the relation of movie
smoking exposure to smoking onset and escalation in a multiwave, nationally rep￾resentative sample of U.S. adolescents. Note that one of the studies noted earlier
(Sargent et al., 2007) identified a relation between movie smoking exposure and
established smoking in the present sample; however, that analysis conflated initiation
and progression (i.e., the authors did not model the relation of movie smoking
exposure with smoking progression over and above the former’s relation to smoking
initiation). We revisit these data in the present study, examining the predictors of
change (transitions) in smoking status over a 2-year period, to clarify whether the
relation previously obtained is largely a function of the relation between exposure
and initiation, or whether exposure is also related to progression. We consider a
range of established predictors of smoking behavior, in an attempt to clarify whether
specific predictors are more (or less) impactful at different points in the smoking tra￾jectory. By using four waves of data, we were able to not only model changes over
several points in time, but also include time-varying predictors.
Method
Participants and Procedure
The present sample included 6,522 adolescents who completed a random-digit-dial
telephone survey of 10–14-year-old children living in the United States. At the first
wave of the survey (T1), our sample had a mean age of 12.05 years (SD ¼ 1.39 years)
and mirrored the general U.S. population aged 10–14 years in terms of gender,
ethnic=racial background, and socioeconomic status (for details, see Sargent et al.,
2005). Respondents were first contacted between June 2003 and October 2003, with
three 8-month follow-up surveys (T2–T4). Details regarding the survey participants
and procedure have been previously reported (Sargent et al., 2005). Briefly, 377,850
U.S. telephone numbers were randomly selected; after purging of non-residential
telephone numbers, 69,516 households were screened for the presence of an eligible
adolescent (29% of households refused). This process identified 9,849 eligible house￾holds, from which 6,522 adolescents (66% of those eligible) completed the T1 survey.
Trained interviewers used a computer-assisted telephone interview system to admin￾ister surveys (in either English or Spanish), which allowed for touch-tone responses
to potentially sensitive questions. The present analysis uses data from T1 through T4
(nT1 ¼ 6,522; nT2 ¼ 5,503; nT3 ¼ 5,019; nT4 ¼ 4,575; at each wave, survey staff
attempted to recontact all the original participants). We used multiple imputation
When Movies Matter 79
of missing data so that the total sample size remains 6,522 at all waves (see the ‘‘Stat￾istical Analysis’’ section for details on the imputation procedure).
Materials
Demographic, Child Personality, and Social Influence Predictors of Smoking
At T1, we assessed numerous factors which were expected, on the basis of past
research, to be significantly correlated with smoking behavior and movie exposure.
In particular, we obtained information on age, gender (‘‘0’’ ¼ male, ‘‘1’’ ¼ female),
racial=ethnic minority status, household income, and parent education (see Table 2
for response categories).
We also measured sensation seeking, rebelliousness, school performance, and
number of extracurricular activities. We measured sensation seeking using a 4-item,
4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not like you) to 4 (just like you), tapping the
thrill=adventure-seeking (e.g., ‘‘I like to do scary things,’’ ‘‘I like to do dangerous
things’’) and boredom susceptibility (e.g., ‘‘I often think there is nothing to do’’)
constructs identified by Zuckerman (1994), and the intensity seeking (e.g., ‘‘I like
to listen to loud music’’) construct identified by Arnett (1994). We measured rebel￾liousness using a 6-item, 4-point Likert-type scale assessing tendency toward anti￾social behavior (e.g., ‘‘I like to break the rules,’’ ‘‘I argue a lot with other kids’’;
Pierce, Farkas, & Evans, 1993). For school performance, participants described their
grades last year as either: excellent, good, average, or below average. They also
reported whether they were involved in various extracurricular activities, including
sports (organized or casual), music, church, school clubs (e.g., science, newspaper),
and community clubs (e.g., scouting).
Social influence predictors included peer, sibling, and parent smoking, and
parental warmth and supervision (Jackson, Henriksen, & Foshee, 1998). We
assessed peer smoking by asking participants, ‘‘How many of your friends smoke
cigarettes?’’ reported on a 3-point scale (‘‘1’’ ¼ none, ‘‘2’’ ¼ some, ‘‘3’’ ¼ most). Sib￾ling smoking was a dichotomous variable indexed by the following question: ‘‘Do
any of your older brothers or sisters smoke cigarettes?’’ (‘‘0’’ ¼ no, ‘‘1’’ ¼ yes; part￾icipants reporting no older siblings were assigned a value of 0). Parent smoking
was indexed by asking respondents (a) whether their mother (or stepmother)
and (b) whether their father (if living with the child) smoke, and combining these
into a single indicator (‘‘0’’ ¼ no parent smokes, ‘‘1’’ ¼ one or both parents smoke).
Parenting style was assessed in reference to the ‘‘the adult guardian you spend the
most time with’’ in an average week. The 5-item parental warmth measure
included items such as ‘‘She makes me feel better when I’m upset’’ and ‘‘She
wants to hear about my problems,’’ whereas the 4-item parental supervision scale
included items such as ‘‘She makes sure I tell her where I’m going’’ and ‘‘She asks
me what I do with my friends’’ (reported on a 4-point scale ranging from
‘‘1’’ ¼ not like her to ‘‘4’’ ¼ just like her, for all items). We also included measures
of access to tobacco: availability of cigarettes in the home (‘‘If you wanted to,
could you get cigarettes from home without your parents knowing?’’; definitely
no to definitely yes) and amount of weekly spending money (an open-ended dollar
amount in response to ‘‘About how much money do you have each week to spend
any way you want?’’).
Some of these variables (sensation seeking, rebelliousness school performance,
extracurriculars, peer smoking, sibling smoking, parenting, availability of cigarettes
80 S. Dal Cin et al.
in the home and weekly spending money) were also measured at subsequent waves
and were included as time-varying covariates in the model through Wave 3. Over
the four survey waves, Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .57 to .62 for sensation seek￾ing, .71 to .76 for rebelliousness, .75 to .83 for parental warmth, and .59 to .67 for
parental supervision.1
Media Exposure
We included two measures of media exposure. One item was used to account for
exposure to television: hours of television usually watched on school days (reported
on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘‘1’’ ¼ none to ‘‘5’’ ¼ more than four hours; entered as
a time-varying predictor through T3). The second measure was designed to index
exposure to movie smoking depictions specifically. At each survey wave, adolescents
reported whether they had ever seen each of 50 different movies, randomly selected
(without replacement) from a predetermined set of popular contemporary movie
titles. At T1, the pool of available titles (n ¼ 534) included the top-grossing movies
each year from 1998 to 2002, and 34 movies grossing more than $15 million USD
in the first quarter of 2003. At subsequent waves, respondents were asked about
50 randomly selected titles drawn from the top theatre releases and video rentals
for the interval between the survey waves (T2 ¼ 161 movies, T3 ¼ 155 movies).
The random samples were stratified by Motion Picture Association of America rat￾ing (and at T2 and T3, source: theatre vs. video). Movies that a respondent reported
seeing at a prior wave were excluded from the sampling frames for his or her
subsequent surveys.
Content analysis of movies was used to quantify depictions of smoking in
movies. One of two trained coders viewed each movie and recorded the number of
smoking occurrences. A smoking occurrence was defined as a character’s use or
handling of a tobacco product or the presence of other smoking imagery (e.g., bill￾board ads). Interrater reliability (the mean kappa for coder agreement on whether
smoking was occurring in 1-s intervals) was .86 (SD ¼ .17), based on double coding
10% of the movies.
We linked the number of smoking occurrences in each movie with the survey
data to estimate exposure to movie depictions of smoking for each respondent.
We did so by first computing the proportion of the total smoking occurrences on
the respondent’s unique list of 50 movies that the respondent saw. This proportion
was obtained by dividing the sum of the smoking occurrences in movies they
reported seeing by the sum of movie smoking occurrences for all of the 50 movies
on their unique list. Then, for overall exposure, each respondent got the raw score
that corresponded to the same proportion from the parent pool of 534 movies, which
we obtained by multiplying the total smoking occurrences in the parent pool by the
respondents proportion from their list of 50 movies. Last, because the size of the
parent pool of movies changed dramatically after Wave 1, we rescaled the sub￾sequent raw scores at Waves 2 and 3 as if they had been obtained from a parent pool
of 534. To do this, we divided the Wave 2 and 3 raw scores by the sizes of the Waves
1
Previously published sensitivity analyses using these (Sargent, et al., 2007) and similar
(Dalton, et al., 2003) data reveal that despite the use of single item measures and scales with
moderate reliability coefficients, there is little evidence that effects of movie smoking exposure
can be attributed to unmeasured confounding variables.
When Movies Matter 81
2 and 3 parent pools, 161 and 155 respectively, and then multiplied by the size of
the Wave 1 parent pool, 534.
Outcome Variables
Smoking status at each wave was determined on the basis of responses to the ques￾tion, ‘‘How many cigarettes have you smoked in your lifetime,’’ and respondents
were classified as Nonsmokers (those reporting 0 cigarettes), experimental smokers
(those reporting 1–99 cigarettes), and established smokers (those reporting 100 or
more cigarettes). As multiple waves of data were available, we also evaluated transi￾tions from one smoking status to another.
Statistical Analysis
We used a Cox hazard model predicting time to transition. This allowed us to
simultaneously model multiple processes (initiation and progression) and repeated
events; the respondents could have more than one forward transition (e.g., from
nonsmoker to experimental smoker, and then from experimental smoker to estab￾lished smoker). We used a robust sandwich estimator to account for this
within-subject dependency in order to obtain accurate standard errors (Therneau
& Grambsch, 2000). Some respondents (7%) reported ‘‘backward’’ transitions;
that is, they reported smoking fewer lifetime cigarettes at a particular wave than
they had reported previously. Backward transitions (which represented 27% of all
transitions) were also modeled in the present analysis; their inclusion did not mod￾ify the pattern of results for initiation and progression. Complete explication of
the backward transitions part of the model was beyond the scope of the present
article. Predictor effects were allowed to be different in all three parts of the
model.
To make estimated effects more comparable across predictors on very different
measurement scales, we linearly rescaled all the ordered categorical predictors with
more than two categories so that the lowest category was scored ‘‘0’’ and the highest
category was scored ‘‘1.’’ For continuous predictors, we linearly rescaled the predic￾tors so the 5th percentile score was ‘‘0’’ and the 95th percentile score was ‘‘1’’ and
then recoded (winsorized) more extreme scores in either direction back to 0 or 1.
Thus, all estimated effects represent going from the low to the high end of the scale,
avoiding extremes, regardless of the gradations in between.
We used the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) procedure in
R to stochastically impute missing data (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, in
press; this procedure is equivalent to the ICE procedure in Stata). To improve the
quality of the imputations, a number of baseline auxiliary variables were included
only in the imputation model that were predictive of missing data but not necessarily
the outcome. All variables were treated as numeric and the predictive mean matching
procedure was used to create 15 imputed values for each missing score. Convergence
was assessed by checking plots of the mean and variance of the imputations for each
variable across the 15 streams for signs of problems such as trends or lack of proper
mixing. No problems were apparent. For descriptive statistics only, we averaged
across the 15 imputations to get a single best estimate for each missing data point.
We fit the Cox hazard model to each of the 15 imputed complete datasets and fol￾lowed standard procedures for pooling the estimates and obtaining standard errors
(van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, in press).
Results
Descriptive Statistics and Overview of the Hazard Model
Baseline descriptive statistics for this sample have been reported previously (Sargent
et al., 2005); see Tables 1–3 for those from this imputed dataset. In total, there were
1,316 forward transitions over the 2-year study period. Of these, 1,150 were from
never to experimental smoker, 142 were from experimental to established smoker,
and 24 from never to established smoker; 4,807 never, 338 experimental, and 22
established smokers reported no transition (their smoking status did not change over
the course of the study), 1,164 individuals reported one forward transition, and 76
reported two forward transitions.
Nonmedia Predictors of Smoking in the Multivariate Model
Graphical representations of point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for all
predictors in the initiation and progression parts of the model are available in
Figure 1.
The same information is presented in Table 4. Age was a significant predic￾tor of smoking behavior, with older participants being more likely to initiate
sooner and to progress faster; gender was unrelated to smoking behavior.
Race=ethnicity was associated with progression, but not initiation: Black, Hispa￾nic, and other visible minority youth had the same time to initiation as Whites,
but Black and Hispanic youth progressed more slowly. With regard to socioeco￾nomic indicators, higher household income was associated with later initiation,
but not with progression, whereas parent education was unrelated to smoking
behavior.
Higher levels of sensation seeking and rebelliousness were associated with earlier
initiation, not with progression. Better school performance predicted later initiation,
whereas more extracurricular activities predicted earlier initiation; neither variable
was related to progression.
Peer, sibling, and parent smoking all predicted shorter time to initiation, but only
peer smoking was related to progression, with more peer smoking predicting faster
progression. Higher parental warmth and supervision predicted later initiation
and slower progression. Youth who reported more weekly spending money
initiated sooner, but this variable was unrelated to progression. In contrast, avail￾ability of cigarettes in the home was associated with starting to smoke sooner, and
progressing.

confidence interval 1.37, 2.01). The hazard ratio association between high exposure
to movie smoking and progression transition was 1.53 (0.84, 2.79). As discussed in
more detail in another report, the movie smoking hazard ratio for smoking onset
was significantly higher among White (adjusted hazard ratio 2.02 [1.56, 2.62]) com￾pared to minority adolescents. Reported TV use was unrelated to smoking initiation
and progression.
Discussion
As expected, exposure to smoking in movies was associated with an increased rate of
smoking initiation. However, it was not associated with subsequent progression of
smoking, which was predicted most strongly by peer smoking, race and ethnicity,
age, and availability of cigarettes in the home. This is consistent with research doc￾umenting the relative stability of behavior once smoking experimentation begins
(Ouellette & Wood, 1998), the potentially rapid onset of nicotine addiction
(DiFranza et al., 2000; DiFranza & Wellman, 2005), and the relation between access
to tobacco and smoking behavior among youth (e.g., Widome, Forster, Hannan, &
Perry, 2007). This raises the question of whether the association between seeing
movie smoking and established smoking seen in previous work (Adachi-Mejia
et al., 2009; Dalton et al., 2009; Sargent et al., 2007) is due to the relatively long time
periods studied (2 years or more), during which many could have initiated and tran￾sitioned to established smoking. However, our results are inconsistent with those of a
1-year longitudinal study of German young people in the same age group as our
respondents (Sargent & Hanewinkel, 2009). It may be that the limited number of
progression transitions observed in the current U.S. sample limits our ability to
detect the effects of our predictor variables. Indeed, in the present analysis, the point
estimates of the effect of movie smoking exposure on initiation and progression are
of about the same magnitude, but the latter has a larger confidence interval.
Although the German study did not report the number of transitions in their sample,
2000–2007 current (30 day) smoking rates among 13–15-year-old youth in Germany
were more than 30%; the rates in the United States were less than half that (www.
tobaccoatlas.org). It may be possible that the German data provide better power
to detect effects of movie smoking exposure on smoking escalation. That said, differ￾ences in smoking rates are likely indicative of other differences in individual, cul￾tural, and social contexts between these samples, and one or more of these

initiation and smoking progression for each risk factor in the model.
differences might moderate the relation between exposure to movie smoking and
smoking progression. As an example, smoking rates suggest that German young
people are more likely than American young people to be among peers who smoke;
thus, the social environment of German youth provides greater affordances for
smoking progression (i.e., an accepting peer group, access to tobacco products) than
does the social environment of American youth. In the presence of those affordances
it is possible that other variables, including mass media influences such as movie
smoking exposure, continue to exert influence.

Do the present results suggest that movie smoking exposure is inconsequential
because we found that it was only associated with smoking onset? No. Indeed, just
the opposite—the relation between exposure to movie smoking and earlier initiation
of smoking is of real concern, because earlier initiation is associated with more prob￾lematic smoking outcomes, including greater likelihood of being a heavy smoker and
less likelihood of quitting (e.g., Breslau & Peterson, 1996; Chen & Millar, 1998).
Thus, to the extent that the relations observed are causal (see National Cancer Insti￾tute, 2008), movie smoking exposure appears to set in motion a behavior (smoking)
that can then be maintained and modified by other influences, in particular, the
immediate social context of smoking (e.g., being among smoking peers) and addic￾tion to nicotine. The present results suggest that the main focus of media smoking
interventions (in the United States, at least) should be on prevention of initiation,
whereas interventions for those who have initiated should perhaps focus on other
modifiable factors, such as those related to peer smoking, parenting, and the avail￾ability of cigarettes in the home.
The present research points out the relative effect of different established predic￾tors of smoking behavior at different points in the smoking trajectory, and highlights
the importance of distinguishing between initiation and progression when conduct￾ing research on smoking uptake. We suggest that the present analytic strategy is a
When Movies Matter 87
useful tool for accomplishing this objective, but that rates of progression should be
attended to in determining sufficient sample size.
It must be noted that the present data, although prospective, are still correla￾tional, and causal conclusions cannot be drawn from an individual correlational
study. Further, the present analyses identify the relations between the predictors
and outcomes, but do not include tests of the underlying processes that account
for these relations. For example, the present results do not explain how movie smok￾ing exposure could lead to initiation. Other reports that focus on process suggest that
inclusion of possible mediators, such as friend smoking, as covariates may result in
an underestimation of the movie influence (Wills et al., 2007; Wills et al., 2008). It is
also important to point out that the present findings do not rule out the possibility of
protective or ameliorative effects from exposure to antismoking depictions in
movies. Previous research has demonstrated the potential public health benefit of
incorporating health promotion messages in entertainment storylines (e.g., Diek￾man, McDonald, & Gardner, 2000; Kennedy, O’Leary, Beck, Pollard, & Simpson,
2004). Our measure of movie exposure does not contain antismoking depictions (it
is rare to see these in movies); it may be that such exposures could to positive health
outcomes such as less (or slower) initiation and progression. We look forward to
future research examining these issues.
