Notwithstanding the promise of efficiency and visual spectacle, ethical concerns, workflow integration, and the preservation of human touch remain. As graphic engines expand cinema's visual possibilities, the connection between gaming and filmmaking reveals the limitless potential that arises when technology and imagination connect." - Joshua KanattDiscover the 14 remarkable ways they are reshaping the very fabric of the film industry, from scriptwriting to post-production, ushering in an era where creativity is amplified by the power of AI and game engines.1. AI-Enhanced Scriptwriting: AI is now a formidable scriptwriting partner. These tools like chatgpt, bard and other tools  analyse vast amounts of data, helping filmmakers generate engaging storylines, plot twists, and even dialogue. The result is not just a script; it's an AI-influenced narrative that sparks fresh ideas and creative directions.   Data-Driven Creativity AI tools leverage vast amounts of data, learning from successful movies to understand audience preferences and Training models on key elements of blockbuster films enable AI to suggest plot points and reactions, enhancing the overall narrative.  AI scripts can adapt to real-time events, allowing filmmakers to weave narratives inspired by the latest news or cultural phenomena.There are lot movies which are created from the real life scenes and latest news such as ( 2018 movie, Dangal, titanic ) where creating a story based on that with immersive experience will be really easy. In an another instance where scriptwriter wanted to make swift change to dive the scene to a different direction by this instance there will be n number of possibilities. AI's ability to process individual preferences allows for the creation of personalised narratives. Filmmakers can tailor elements of the story to specific audience segments, enhancing tools excels in suggesting unexpected plot twists, injecting unpredictability into the storyline. This dynamic approach keeps audiences engaged and invested in the unfolding narrative's. instances where scriptwriters desire a swift change in direction, AI offers instant ideation. This responsiveness allows for exploration and experimentation in storytelling.2. Scheduling and Charting Movie  : One of the biggest obstacles that filmmakers have when planning and arranging their filming is the unpredictable nature of weather. When it comes to forecasting future weather patterns, traditional approaches frequently fall short, which causes delays, interruptions, and higher expenses. Shoot planning is made more difficult by the dearth of comprehensive methods for predicting seasonal fluctuations and allocating resources optimally.  AI transforms filmmakers' ability to predict future weather patterns by analysing historical weather data, satellite imagery, and atmospheric conditions with unprecedented precision.  AI's nuanced analysis of historical climatic data aids filmmakers in anticipating seasonal variations and temperature ranges, facilitating comprehensive shoot planning. With the capacity to assess the risk of weather-related disruptions, AI provides filmmakers with contingency plans, ensuring preparedness and minimising delays. The dynamic adjustment of shooting schedules based on real-time weather updates allows for automated rescheduling or alternative location recommendations in adverse conditions. AI also optimises resource allocation, including travel time, equipment setup, and crew availability, leading to cost savings and enhanced efficiency.3. Lighting and Scene Exploration:  Addressing a longstanding challenge in filmmaking, traditional pre-visualisation methods have often fallen short in efficiently visualising scenes and planning lighting schemes. Filmmakers grapple with the limitations of conventional approaches, leading to extended planning phases and a lack of precision in capturing the emotional tone of the script.  Graphic tools in filmmaking, fuelled by AI capabilities, revolutionise the visualisation of scenes. AI not only suggests optimal lighting schemes but also recommends scenes aligned with the script's emotional tone, anticipating potential questions or storyline changes. This advanced pre-visualisation enhances the efficiency of the planning process, providing filmmakers with powerful tools for crafting compelling visual narratives. In the realm of artificial lighting, AI contributes to sustainable filmmaking practices by recommending energy-efficient solutions, aligning with broader environmental considerations. In essence, AI emerges as an indispensable ally, revolutionising the movie industry's scheduling and charting approach with unprecedented efficiency and foresight.4. Future of Acting with Character Monetisation:  There is a rising need from viewers in the present cinematic environment for their favourite performers to play a variety of parts in different films. This dream might soon come true with the development of graphic tools and AI capabilities. Character Monetisation Opportunities are now available thanks to this progression, allowing for the incredibly flexible creation of digital characters. AI creates remarkably realistic body replicas and alters a character's emotions, age, and behaviours with ease. This presents intriguing revenue opportunities in addition to improving storytelling by enabling the examination of many character dynamics inside a single story. Imagine the character played by your favourite actor continuing to appear in other artistic projects. Actors now have more opportunities to earn money from their roles, allowing producers to dynamically alter expressions, ages, and emotions.5. Revolutionising virtual Production with Unreal Engine:The film industry's set design process has often been affected by difficulties like resource-intensive construction, little flexibility during filming, and the requirement for significant post-production adjustments. Filmmakers frequently encountered difficulties when trying to visualise and customise sets in real time, which could result in workflow inefficiencies throughout the entire production process. The filmmaking industry has undergone an enormous shift with the release of Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5.2, especially in the area of virtual production. This creative tool provides a dynamic and adaptable solution to the problems with traditional set design. Filmmakers can design complex virtual sets, see scenes in real time, and make last-minute changes while filming thanks to Unreal Engine.6. Predicting Film Success: AI is being used beyond scripts to analyse scripts in order to predict a film's future success. Examples of this type of application are Cinelytic and ScriptBook. AI explores a variety of sources, including as publications, review pages, Instagram postings, Twitter feeds, and more, highlighting the growing industry dependence on algorithmic forecasts for box office results. AI develops becoming a potent tool for predicting the future box office performance of films by training several models on a variety of consumer profiles and historical data. This helps make better data-driven and strategic decisions in the ever-changing film business by utilising information from a variety of internet channels and user interactions.7. AI-Driven Dynamic Advertising and Targeted Marketing : With the use of artificial intelligence (AI), adverts can be dynamically tailored depending on the distinct interests and demographics of each viewer, increasing engagement and guaranteeing a more meaningful advertising experience. Simultaneously, AI is essential for deciphering and evaluating audience behaviour for successful marketing campaigns. Artificial intelligence (AI) generates detailed audience profiles by mining social media and other online platforms for insights. This allows marketers and content providers to target particular demographics with their material. The industry is able to create focused and successful campaigns by using data-driven audience research and marketing, which eventually improves the entire viewing experience. - Create a heading for this"In the near future, advertising brands will take a bigger leap in appear in movies, series and videos based on the tastes of individual viewers. For instance, once a film has been post-produced and a fashion brand wants to work with it to showcase their shirt, it can switch out all of the cast members' shirts with that brand when desired." - Joshua Kanatt ( Founder & CEO - GAMERS TAG )8. Editing & Modification : In the world of filmmaking, it may be quite difficult to make changes after the fact, particularly after the film has been filmed. This procedure requires a lot of labour and costs a lot of money. After filming, traditional editing techniques are frequently inadequate for incorporating last-minute alterations or perfecting artistic components. The creative answer to this problem is the incorporation of AI algorithms into graphic tools. Filmmakers may use these cutting-edge technologies in post-production to create complex and seamless changes. AI integration simplifies the editing process, allowing for quick and economical adjustments. This gives artists the ability to hone and polish details inside frames, change an object's orientation, and attain a previously unheard-of degree of creative control. This gives post-production artists more opportunities for creative expression while also streamlining the editing process. By integrating AI, the problems brought about by inflexible pre-production processes are lessened, resulting in a filmmaking process that is more flexible and dynamic.9. Redefining the Process with In-Camera Effects: Applying visual effects to traditional filmmaking frequently presents significant difficulties, particularly in post-production. Workflows that need significant editing procedures, such as the use of green screens and CGI, are resource- and time-intensive. Significant delays, higher production costs, and less creative freedom may result from this. To overcome these obstacles, the incorporation of graphic tools—undoubtedly best represented by Unreal Engine 5 provides a creative fix in the form of in-camera effects. By seamlessly fusing virtual settings with live-action scenarios in real-time, this method completely changes the landscape of filmmaking and does away with the necessity for laborious post-production editing. Filmmakers are able to work more efficiently and creatively than ever before when they visualise and record sequences using virtual components during the real shot.10. AI-Driven Casting : Choosing the most suitable actors for roles throughout the casting process has proven to be a difficult and individualised filmmaking process. It was frequently difficult for filmmakers to do a thorough analysis of an actor's past performances and determine if they would work well in a given role. This dearth of data-driven insights may cause casting decisions to rely more on subjective assessments and be less well-informed and It was also difficult understanding the nuances of an actor's micro-expressions and predicting new expressions was a challenging task. Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolutionises this process by evaluating an actor's past performances, assessing audience response, and forecasting their fit for particular roles. This data-driven methodology guarantees better informed casting choices. Choosing actors who can provide the best performances for a scene is made easier by AI's extraordinary capacity to read micro-expressions and predict future ones from trained models. This improves the whole cinematic experience.11. Taking Advantage of AI to Revolutionise Film Editing: Time and accuracy constraints frequently consume traditional film editing. It can be difficult and time-consuming to edit long footage to make interesting trailers or polish full-length films. It also takes close attention to detail to make sure that the edited material matches the intended emotional tone and narrative flow. Artificial Intelligence has become a disruptive force in film editing, providing answers to long-standing problems. The ability to recognise faces and analyse scenes through AI tools gives editors the ability to optimise their workflows. These tools make it easier to quickly go through large amounts of footage, pinpoint important moments, and identify the actors' emotional cues. Artificial Intelligence (AI) speeds up and improves accuracy of editing by automating some of its processes.Editors may create visually striking and captivating content that appeals to the target audience by utilising AI-driven insights. This combination of AI support and human creativity represents a major advancement in the movie editing industry, offering more effective and powerful narrative in the digital age.12. AI's Revolutionary Impact on Music Composition:  The process of writing music for motion pictures frequently presented challenges with regard to time, money, and artistic freedom. It was difficult for composers to create original music that matched a variety of film situations, which made the process laborious and occasionally iterative. The film industry is going through a transformative moment with the rise of AI-based music composition tools. By addressing the shortcomings of the conventional method, AI provides human composers with invaluable assistance. Although AI-generated music may be met with scepticism, the technology demonstrates its potential by helping composers create original works that are customised to suit various movie situations. AI creates music that accentuates particular moods, scenes, or plot points by analysing enormous musical datasets, learning from a variety of genres, and creating original works. The possibilities for film scoring have been broadened by this partnership between human creativity and AI-driven support. AI tools can help composers become more creative, try out new sounds, and quickly create soundtracks that improve the cinematic experience in general. In the context of contemporary filmmaking, the incorporation of AI into music composition is a harmonious fusion of technology and artistic expression.13. Revolutionising Editing with Real-Time Rendering: Filmmaking poses many challenges when it comes to rendering, especially with regard to time and interactivity. The creative process was hampered by bottlenecks such as waiting for rendered previews and seeing edits in real time during collaborative sessions. This frequently resulted in delays and reduced editing process efficiency. A revolution in filmmaking has occurred with the introduction of real-time rendering, made possible by programmes like Unreal Engine. Industry standards have been revolutionised by Unreal Engine's ability to render in real-time (at least 24 frames per second) and provide an interface akin to a real set.  By allowing for instantaneous visualisation of edits, this innovation tackles the issues related to traditional rendering. Filmmakers can quickly alter their plans and see the effects right away.  This helps the creative team work in a more interactive and collaborative environment while also speeding up the editing process. Filmmakers can experiment with various visual elements, explore creative possibilities, and make quick decisions thanks to real-time rendering. A major breakthrough in the digital age of cinema, the editing workflow's increased agility leads to more effective, dynamic, and visually spectacular filmmaking.14. Post-production Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables video editing tools to identify patterns in footage, automate editing tasks, and improve overall efficiency. They provide automatic video summaries, help with shot selection, and remove extraneous elements.Topaz Labs' video upscaling AI tool, for instance, sharpens and improves video quality while offering 4K resolution at 60 frames per second.I decrease the amount of time and money needed for visual effects production by automating processes like motion tracking and rotoscoping. This increases independent filmmakers' access to VFX. Because AI tools automate tasks, they open up creative possibilities and collaborative opportunities. This makes it easier for filmmakers to collaborate remotely and gives them more time to explore creative and reduces production costs and saves time by automating tasks. Colour grading is streamlined by programmes like Colourlab.Ai, which give filmmakers strong, time-saving capabilities.“ One of the key characters that we are bringing to life, we are able to use machine learning to give our animators much higher resolution characters to work with. “  - THEO JONES, FRAMESTOREChallenges Faced by the Film Industry with AI and Graphic Engines:1. Efficiency and Workflow: While AI enhances post-production efficiency, integrating these tools poses challenges in adapting workflows and ensuring seamless collaboration between artists and AI systems.2. Use Case Integration: The diverse applications of AI, from screenwriting to VFX and distribution, bring challenges in integrating these tools cohesively into the filmmaking process, requiring a comprehensive understanding of each use case.3. Feedback Precision: Despite AI's potential to enhance animator feedback with higher resolution characters, challenges exist in achieving real-time precision, impacting decision-making in fast-paced production environments.4. Regulatory Framework: The Writers Guild of America's stance on regulating AI-generated content raises questions about standardized regulations, copyright issues, and the determination of writing credits in this evolving landscape.5. Job Displacement Concerns: The adoption of AI tools raises concerns about potential job displacement in creative fields, necessitating a delicate balance between AI assistance and preserving human creativity.6. Copyright and Ownership Complexity: The use of AI in content generation introduces complexities in determining copyright and ownership, requiring the industry to address legal and attribution challenges for AI-generated content.7. Bias in Recommendations: AI algorithms for content recommendations may inadvertently reinforce biases present in training data, posing challenges in delivering diverse and unbiased content recommendations.8. Data Privacy: The collection and analysis of user data for personalized recommendations raise concerns about data privacy, requiring the industry to navigate the delicate balance between personalization and safeguarding user privacy.9. Creativity and Emotional Depth: Challenges arise in assessing whether AI-generated movies can match the creative depth and emotional resonance of human-crafted works, posing questions about the unique touch of human storytelling.10. Ethical Considerations: Filmmakers grapple with ethical considerations related to data privacy, biases, and potential job displacement, emphasizing the need for responsible AI practices to maintain artistic expression and fair employment practices.Graphic engines and AI will continues to redefine the boundaries of what is visually and efficiency achievable in cinema, its adoption underscores the symbiotic relationship between the gaming and filmmaking industries, proving that groundbreaking visual effects can emerge from the unexpected fusion of technology and creativity.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-film-industry-14-ways-artificial-intelligence-game-kanatt-wzcscPost-War HollywoodThe film industry changed radically after World War II, and this change altered the style and content of the films made in Hollywood. After experiencing boom years from 1939 to 1946, the film industry began a long period of decline. Within just seven years, attendance and box receipts fell to half their 1946 levels. Part of the reason was external to the industry. Many veterans returning from World War II got married, started families, attended college on the GI Bill, and bought homes in the suburbs. All these activities took a toll on box office receipts. Families with babies tended to listen to the radio rather than go to the movies; college students placed studying before seeing the latest film; and newlyweds purchasing homes, automobiles, appliances, and other commodities had less money to spend on movies. Then, too, especially after 1950, television challenged and surpassed the movies as America's most popular entertainment form. In 1940, there were just 3,785 TV sets in the United States. Two decades later, nine homes in every ten had at least one TV set. For preceding Americans, clothing styles, speech patterns, and even moral attitudes and political points of view had been shaped by the movies. For post-World War II Americans, television largely took the movies' place as a dominant cultural influence. The new medium reached audiences far larger than those attracted by motion pictures, and it projected images right into family's living rooms. Internal troubles also contributed to Hollywood's decline. Hollywood's founding generation--Harry Cohn, Samuel Goldwyn Louis B. Mayer, Darryl Zanuck--retired or were forced out as new corporate owners, lacking movie experience, took over. The film companies had high profiles, glamour, undervalued stock, strategically located real estate, and film libraries which television networks desperately needed. In short, they were perfect targets for corporate takeovers. The studios reduced production, sold off back lots, and made an increasing number of pictures in Europe, where costs were lower. Meanwhile, Hollywood's foreign market began to vanish. Hollywood had depended on overseas markets for as much as 40 percent of its revenue. But in an effort to nurture their own film industries and prevent an excessive outflow of dollars, Britain, France, and Italy imposed stiff import tariffs and restrictive quotas on imported American movies. With the decline in foreign markets, movie making became a much riskier business. Then an antitrust ruling separated the studios from their theater chains. In 1948, the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in the Paramount case, which had been working its ways through the courts for almost a decade. The court's decree called for the major studios to divest themselves of their theater chains. In addition to separating theater and producer- distributor companies, the court also outlawed block booking, the fixing of admissions prices, unfair runs and clearances, and discriminatory pricing and purchasing arrangements. With this decision, the industry the moguls built--the vertically integrated studio--died. If the loss of foreign revenues shook the financial foundation of the industry, the end of block booking (a practice whereby the exhibitor is forced to take all of a company's pictures to get any of that company's pictures) shattered the weakened buttress. Film making had become a real crap shoot. One result of the Paramount decision and the end of the monopoly of film making by the majors was an increase in independent productions. Yet despite a host of innovations and gimmicks--including 3-D, Cinerama, stereophonic sound, and cinemascope--attendance continued to fall. Hollywood also suffered from Congressional probes of communist influence in the film industry. In the late 1930s, the House of Representatives established the Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to combat subversive right-wing and left-wing movements. Its history was less than distinguished. From the first it tended to see subversive Communists everywhere at work in American society. HUAC even announced that the Boy Scouts were Communist infiltrated. During the late 1940s and early 1950s HUAC picked up the tempo of its investigation, which it conducted in well-publicized sessions. Twice during this period HUAC traveled to Hollywood to investigate Communist infiltration in the film industry. HUAC first went to Hollywood in 1947. Although it didn't find the party line preached in the movies, it did call a group of radical screenwriters and producers into its sessions to testify. Asked if they were Communists, the "Hollywood Ten" refused to answer questions about their political beliefs. As Ring Lardner, Jr., one of the ten, said, "I could answer...but if I did, I would hate myself in the morning." They believed that the First Amendment protected them. In the politically charged late 1940s, however, their rights were not protected. Those who refused to divulge their political affiliations were tried for contempt of Congress, sent to prison for a year, and blacklisted. HUAC went back to Hollywood in 1951. This time it called hundreds of witnesses from both the political right and the political left. Conservatives told HUAC that Hollywood was littered with "Commies." Walt Disney even recounted attempts to have Mickey Mouse follow the party line. Of the radicals, some talked but most didn't. To cooperate with HUAC entailed "naming names"--that is, informing on one's friends and political acquaintances. Again, those who refused to name names found themselves unemployed and unemployable. All told, about 250 directors, writers, and actors were black listed. In 1948, writer Lillian Hellman denounced the industry's moral cowardice in scathing terms: "Naturally, men scared to make pictures about the American Negro, men who only in the last year allowed the word Jew to be spoken in a picture, who took more than ten years to make an anti-fascist picture, these are frightened men and you pick frightened men to frighten first. Judas goats, they'll lead the others to slaughter for you." The HUAC hearings and blacklistings discouraged Hollywood from producing politically controversial films. Fear that a motion picture dealing with the life of Hiawatha might be regarded as communist propaganda led Monogram Studio to shelve the project. As The New York Times explained: "It was Hiawatha's efforts as a peacemaker among warring Indian tribes that gave Monogram particular concern. These it was decided might cause the picture to be regarded as a message for peace and therefore helpful to present communist designs." The hearings encouraged Hollywood to produce musicals, biblical epics, and other politically neutral films. The HUAC hearings also convinced Hollywood producers to make 50 strongly anticommunist films between 1947 and 1954. Most were second-rate movies starring third-rate actors. The films assured Americans that Communists were thoroughly bad people--they didn't have children, they exhaled cigarette smoke too slowly, they murdered their "friends," and they went berserk when arrested. As one film historian has commented, the communists in these films even looked alike; most were "apt to be exceptionally haggard or disgracefully pudgy," and there was certainly "something terribly wrong with a woman if her slip straps showed through her blouse." If these films were bad civic lessons, they did have an impact. They seemed to confirm HUAC's position that Communists were everywhere, that subversives lurked in every shadow. It is ironic that at the same time that HUAC was conducting its investigations of communist subversion, moral censorship of the movies began to decline. In 1949, Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief became the first film to be successfully exhibited without a seal of approval. Despite its glimpses of a brothel and a boy urinating, this Italian film's neo-realist portrait of a poor man's search for his stolen bicycle received strong editorial support from newspapers and was shown in many theaters. In 1952, the Supreme Court reversed a 1915 decision and extended First Amendment protections of free speech to the movies. The landmark case overturned an effort by censors in New York State to ban Roberto Rosselini's film The Miracle on grounds of sacrilege. In addition, the court decreed that filmmakers could challenge censors' findings in court. The next year, Otto Preminger's sex comedy The Moon Is Blue became the first major American film to be released without the code's seal. Even though the film was condemned by the Legion of Decency for its use of the words "virgin" and "pregnant," efforts to boycott the film fizzled and the film proved to be a box office success. In 1966, the film industry abandoned the Production Code, replacing it with a film rating system which is still in force.https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=127Will ‘Barbenheimer’ change the movie industry or is it just an anomaly?If you were in and around a movie theater last weekend, it might have seemed like you had gone back in time. Theaters were bustling, buttered popcorn was flowing and moviegoers were filling up seats in record time.It’s all thanks to “Barbenheimer,” the unlikely twin release of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” that took theaters, the box office and the movie industry at large by storm. During its opening weekend, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” brought in $162 million domestically, while “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s three-hour, half black-and-white historical drama generated $82.4 million––and their momentum has only continued during the week.It’s a shocking reversal from the empty theaters of the pandemic and post-pandemic world. It’s also a notable shift for the industry in another important way: Both films are non-sequels and non-superhero films directed by auteurs with specific visions, not cookie-cutter franchise constraints.At a time when the industry is taking stock of a box office boon––and ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes––the question for Hollywood is whether “Barbenheimer” and the chord it struck with audiences is an anomaly or a sign that there is a sea change occurring in the industry.Steve Granelli, associate professor of communication studies at Northeastern University, says it all depends on what lessons studios and the industry at large take away from this.“There’s a good lesson and a scary lesson,” Granelli says.“The scarier lesson is this idea of product as subject,” he continues. “There was this glut of product-based films, whether it was BlackBerry or Flaming Hot Cheetos or Air Jordans. Barbie is the most elevated form of all of that, where it’s taking this known cultural entity, but then the known cultural entity was handed over to an auteur. … The idea that ‘everybody’s had Hot Wheels, so we’re making a Hot Wheels movie,’ that’s the scary part.”Granelli’s nightmare is not entirely unfounded; in fact, it’s already coming true. In the immediate afterglow of “Barbie,” Mattel, the toy company behind the doll, announced plans to develop films based on 14 of its properties, including Polly Pocket and Barney.Although “Barbie” is Gerwig’s singularly creative interpretation, it’s still a known IP with a built-in audience. For studios like Warner Bros. Discovery, which is grappling with billions of dollars of debt, that kind of low-risk proposition is enticing. Granelli says the success of both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which tells a well-known story in its own way, might reinforce Hollywood’s doubling down on known quantities, not new ideas.But the reason “Barbenheimer” continues to be such a big hit is not just because people played with Barbies as a kid or learned about the father of the atomic bomb in school. The all-encompassing marketing campaign the “Barbie” team ran did a lot of heavy lifting. The dual release of two such different movies organically and virally also encouraged people to set up their own double features, dress up and talk about which movie they saw and which they didn’t, Granelli says.But the movies themselves also played a big role. Both films are big, creative swings from directors who are taking creative risks with IP. Granelli says there is a lesson there for studios, if they want to hear it.“The positive lesson is the built-in audience and being able to play with people’s expectations and experiences with that, but the downfall is that there’s only so much of that we can do if we’re not going to have people celebrate original ideas,” Granelli says.Even if both films aren’t original stories, they are outside the sequel-driven, superhero-focused blockbuster focus that has defined the industry for the last decade and more. And they came at a time when those films are waning in popularity and box office performance.“I think this happened at the right time, in the right summer, after the right string of movies bombing,” Granelli says. “I think we’re in a real transition phase, and we need a ‘Barbie’ and an ‘Oppenheimer’ and a number of other films that are coming up this year to do well to show that there are initial stories that are still resonating with audiences.”Whether “Barbenheimer” indicates a broader interest in non-IP driven stories is yet to be seen. Granelli has his eye on films like Martin Scorsese’s upcoming “Killers of the Flower Moon,” a historical epic, or even a film like “The Bikeriders,” an ensemble-driven story about a fledgling motorcycle club starring Tom Hardy and recent Oscar nominee Austin Butler.“It’s one of these [films] where it’s an original idea, it’s an ensemble cast, it’s a film that’s going to look really good in the theater,” Granelli says. “I’m like, ‘Let’s see how that does.’”“Barbenheimer” was an anomaly in so many ways––from the studio and organic marketing around it to the time it hit the industry and the filmmakers at the center of it. Granelli is hesitant to call it a “singular moment,” but he’s adamant it is an important one for the industry, in more ways than one.“There were a lot of intervening factors that made this a really exciting weekend for the industry,” Granelli says. “Also, during such an exciting time for the industry, there’s the actors’ strike and the writers’ strike, so this is probably the worst time for this to have happened for the studios because now it just draws more attention to the actors and writers, who are like, ‘We’re the reason people went [to the theater].’”https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/07/27/barbenheimer-movie-industry/
