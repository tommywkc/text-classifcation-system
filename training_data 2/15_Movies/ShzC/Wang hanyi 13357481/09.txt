Abstract Our objective in this paper is to assess the values of
online user reviews for movies compared with the sales im pact of post-release ad spending for movies. We use weekly
box-office sales and ad spending data for 304 movies released
in the U.S. along with online ratings and user characteristics
from a social network site for movies. By exploiting the fixed effects two-stage instrumental variable approach to account
for movie heterogeneity and simultaneous relationships
among user reviews, ad spending and sales, we found that
improving the volume and valence of ratings can have the
equivalent effect that ad spending can provide.

1 Introduction
Since entering into the Web 2.0 era, users have been more
active and effective in creating their own opinions, sharing
information, and connecting with peers of the same interest.
This powerful network effect has allowed a small number of
platforms to attract a large amount of traffic. As a result, online
video and social networking sites are becoming the most pop ular websites worldwide (Wunsch-Vincent and Vickery
2007). In such sites, users post and share their product expe riences which have the potential to affect significantly product
sales (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Dellarocas et al. 2007; Li
et al. 2011; Li and Hitt 2008; Luo and Zhang 2013; Moe and
Trusov 2011). Also, firms are seeking favorable and cred ible recommendations and ratings of their products from
users (Ansari et al. 2000; Charband and Jafari Navimipour
2016; Godes and Mayzlin 2004; Hoffman 2000; Murthi
and Sarkar 2003), as rational consumers pay more atten tion to anonymous online product reviews to make more
informed decisions. As such, online product reviews in e commerce context is one type of recommendation system
that explicitly or implicitly collects a consumer’s prefer ences and recommends products or services (Li and
Karahanna 2015; Wei et al. 2013).
As consumers become more engaged and generate opin ions about products in the online environment, consumer created information becomes more prominent and relevant
to consumers than other product information created by
sellers. Also, online consumer reviews take on a special role
in traditional marketing communications by gaining benefits
from social network technologies; that is, the reviews influ ence not only product attractiveness by valence of the reviews
but also product awareness from an increased level of online
Bbuzz^ in the market (Xiong and Bharadwaj 2014; Zhang and
Piramuthu 2016) and online social networks. However, this
powerful element acting as a free Bsales assistant^ does not
come without risks because marketers cannot fully control the
online conversation taking place around their products, unlike
other information created by sellers.
In spite of the reviews’ crucial role in social media, most
extant studies have focused on examining direct or indirect

relationships between online consumer reviews and product
sales in the absence of the traditional marketing mix, mainly
due to the difficulty to obtain firms’ private marketing data.
Hence, only few studies (Bruce et al. 2012; Trusov et al. 2009)
have illustrated whether dynamically changing online con sumer reviews can create comparable effects to the advertising
effects over time. These studies employ different empirical
approaches for addressing the potential estimation issue of
endogeneity among online consumer reviews, marketing
mix, and product sales. However, their approaches (e.g.,
Vector autoregressive regression in Trusov et al. (2009) and
Bayesian dynamic modeling in Bruce et al. (2012)) might
present some limitations to effectively deal with the
endogeneity concern. Our modeling effort in this article aims
to find more unbiased estimates of the dynamic and relative
effects of ad spending and online user reviews on sales than
prior empirical approaches by handling every possible
endogeneity issue. Our rich dataset featuring both cross sectional and time-series aspects of online user reviews, such
users’ social and demographic characteristics, ad spending,
and product sales enables us to achieve this goal by control ling for endogeneity concerns stemming from the static and
dynamic interrelationships among online user reviews, ad
spending and product sales.
In conducting this research, we consider movies as the
products of interest and model weekend box-office sales using
post-release weekly ad spending and the valence and volume
of weekly online user movie ratings. To address the aforemen tioned endogeneity issues in the sales model, we use a two stage instrumental variable approach based on the fixed ef fects estimation by mainly using social and demographic char acteristics of rating users as instrumental variables.
Our results indicate that there is a substantial and dynamic
effect of post-release ad spending on the subsequent box office sales, as expected. In addition, we show specifically
that the dynamics observed in a movie’s valence (average
rating) and volume of users’ ratings can have direct and im mediate impacts on its subsequent sales. We also compare the
effects of the rating dynamics with the effect of post-release ad
spending and demonstrate the economic value of online con sumer ratings as a type of online social media.
In contrast with many of the published studies in this area
of research that use most commonly available cross-sectional
data on product ratings and sales rank at a fixed point in time
(see, e.g.,Chevalier & Mayzlin 2006), we model variation in
box-office sales over a large set of movies over time. Our
unique data differentiate our research from those previous
studies, as we can observe longitudinal user ratings from a
social network site where we can identify the demographics
and social characteristics (such as number of friends) of the
posters. Also, the longitudinal nature of advertising spending
and box-office sales data allow us to examine changes in box office sales from period to period as a function of changes in
the ratings and the advertising spending. The richness of this
dataset enables us to control for unobserved and time invariant movie heterogeneity and the simultaneous relation ships between the ratings, ad spending and sales.
In the next section, we review the existing literature study ing sales impacts of online consumer ratings. After the litera ture review, we present a conceptual framework that defines
the relationships between box-office sales, post-release adver tising, and online consumer ratings. Then, we describe the
data which include movie level and individual level informa tion. In particular, we highlight in our data some of the char acteristics of the rating users in the social network site featured
that are highly relevant instrumental variables for the estima tion techniques we use. We then develop models of post release advertising, volume and valence of ratings, and week end box-office sales, all of which enable us to decompose the
advertising effect and assess the sales impact of user ratings.
We then present the results and highlight some of the
implications.
2 Literature Review of the Sales Impacts of Online
Consumer Reviews
There is ample research on the effects of online consumer created information on sales in both the marketing literature
and the information technology literature (e.g., Bruce et al.
2012; Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Chintagunta et al. 2010;
Dellarocas et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2013; Maeyer 2012; Moe and
Trusov 2011; Pathak et al. 2010). These articles have consid ered various forms of online consumer-created information
such as numerical ratings and text reviews provided by users.
Most of them focus on three measures of online user reviews –
the valence of reviews (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Duan
et al. 2008; Lee and Tan 2013; Liu 2006; Moe & Trusov
2011), the volume of reviews (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006;
Duan et al. 2008; Liu 2006; Moe and Trusov 2011), and the
variation in reviews (Godes and Mayzlin 2004; Moe and
Trusov 2011). An average rating score most frequently repre sents valence and the number of posted ratings most common ly represents volume. Statistical variance or entropy measur ing dispersion in ratings often describes variation in the rat ings. There are varying empirical findings in the literature on
how online consumer reviews of a product impact its sales
with respect to valence, volume and variation. Several studies
report positive effects of valence and volume of user reviews
on book sales for online retailers such as Amazon.com or
BarnesandNoble.com (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Li and
Hitt 2008). Chen et al. (2004), however, report no effect of
user ratings on sales from a similar data source of Amazon.
com.
Similarly, Duan et al. (2009) look at the impact of user
ratings on software adoption and find that user ratings have
830 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
no significant impact on the adoption of popular software. Liu
(2006) and Duan et al. (2008) do not find any significant
impact of rating valence on movie box-office sales of movies
but significant and positive impact on the volume of reviews.
Dellarocas et al. (2007) also find that both the valence and
volume of online user ratings have significant effects on mov ie box-office sales, but they examine the patterns of sales
growth, rather than modeling weekly sales. Forman et al.
(2008) find a stronger association between user reviews and
sales in the presence of reviewer identity disclosure. Moe and
Trusov (2011) argue that the real value of online customer
product ratings depends on cross product temporal variations
in ratings influenced socially and Centeno et al. (2015) con clude that pairwise evaluations should be used in social net works to extract the reputation of entities.
As such, most extant studies have tended to examine the
isolated impact of online user reviews on sales or other per formance outcomes, thus neglecting any co-existing effects of
traditional marketing on sales. Recently, there is an emerging
area of this field to fill the gap in the literature.
First, Chintagunta et al. (2010) empirically examine the
impacts of user reviews on box-office sales by accounting
for a static measure of pre-release advertising and endogenous
user reviews. They use the sequential release of movies across
different markets as instruments for user reviews and show the
valence of reviews is the main driver of box-office perfor mance, not volume. However, the study cannot examine the
dynamics of sales impacts of online reviews and ongoing ad vertising simultaneously due to the static pre-release ad spend ing data. Our model includes time-varying post-release ad
spending data which is mapped to the same time line of user
reviews. In addition, our identification strategy exploits social
and demographic characteristics of users as another plausible
instrument for user ratings, which marketers can alternatively
seek to find when the sequential release of products across
markets is not available. Gopinath et al. (2014) also found that
only the valence of online user reviews has a direct impact on
sales while the impact of the content of advertisements de creases over time. They use a dynamic hierarchical model
structure to investigate the evolving dynamic effects of user
reviews and advertisements while also accounting for the po tential endogeneity concern. However, the absence of actual
ad spending information in their data limits the ability to quan tify the relative effects economically.
Second, using a Bayesian dynamic linear model, Bruce
et al. (2012) show that the dynamics of ad spending and online
user reviews (valence and volume) influence demand for new
products. They further argue that, increased review activities
at a later stage could become more powerful in driving de mand, while increased ad spending is more effective at an
earlier stage due to synergy with the reviews. Although, the
findings in our study are quite consistent with their results, our
modeling effort would be more practical for marketers to
obtain more consistent and unbiased estimates because other
models (such as Bayesian dynamic linear model and Vector
auto regression in Trusov et al. (2009)) provides limitations to
explicitly testing assumptions to detect different endogenous
relationships among variables. Our modeling approach to ac counting for the endogeneity by finding the appropriate instru mental variables (IV) allows the researcher to remain agnostic
about the nature of firm behavior that generates the correlation
between the observed and unobserved factors (Chintagunta
et al. 2006). In summary, these articles in this emerging area
have found the dynamic and relative impacts of marketing
effort and online user reviews on product performance (See
Table 1). Our study not only consistently demonstrates the
relative effects with the prior studies but also provides an
alternative and practical way of estimating such effects to
marketers.
3 Conceptual Framework
We first conceptualize our model to estimate the sales impacts
of post-release advertising and online user ratings before
discussing our data and proposed model. Figure 1 illustrates
the relationship between box-office sales and user ratings over
time and includes key constructs from the dynamics of mar keting and user evaluation. In this research, we observe a
movie’s weekly box-office sales, weekly advertising spending
on the movie, and weekly user movie ratings for the movie
from a social network website for movies. We also include the
characteristics of the site’s posting users, which create valu able constructs to understand how the users generate their
ratings. By analyzing the relationships in the conceptual
framework, we attempt to examine comparable effects of
post-release advertising and online user ratings in order to
quantify the values of online user ratings as social media.
Once a movie is released (at t = 0 in Fig. 1), a movie
marketer may plan the level of post-release advertising to
increase her subsequent sales. This marketing decision can
be sequential and influenced by the movie’s prior perfor mance, characteristics, and environmental factors. In contrast
with pre-release advertising belonging to a fixed portion of the
product budget (Chintagunta et al. 2010), post-release adver tising is a dynamic and temporal decision making process
given the progressions of prior product performance and the
extent of inter-movie competition. After observing current
performance of a movie, its maker may want to adjust her
marketing strategy. In theory, the past performance weighs
most heavily in the maker’s post-release advertising decisions.
However, the producer may simply choose to execute the
post-release advertising according to her preplanned market ing strategy. Therefore, we posit that post-release adverting
reflects the combined effects of the previous week’s movie
performance and any time invariant prebuilt marketing
831 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
strategy. As such, when we model box- office sales, post release advertising is potentially endogenous because (1)
post-release advertising plans vary across movies and (2)
post-release advertising is simultaneously determined with
other contemporaneous variables related to sales. Therefore,
we need to account for the endogeneity of post-release adver tising in modeling box-office sales.
Online user reviews are generated as moviegoers contrib ute reviews in an online movie community. After a moviegoer
watches a movie, the consumer may want to contribute her
own review based on her post evaluation in an online site. In
theory, this post evaluation is heavily influenced by the con sumer’s perceived quality, independent assessment of the
movie, and individual characteristics. In addition, the movie’s
surrounding quality information such as post-release advertis ing, box-office sales, and social dynamics of other users’ rat ings may also affect her rating choice (Lee et al. 2015; Ma
et al. 2014). In a movie review site, the site usually aggregates
those user reviews to present a summary of the reviews.
Therefore, when we model box- office sales as a function of
online user reviews, the reviews are potentially endogenous
because the movie ratings can be correlated with current or
previous sales and advertising (Chintagunta et al. 2010).
Therefore, we need to account for the endogeneity of these
user reviews in modeling box-office sales.
The objective of our modeling effort is to identify the un biased effects of post-release advertising and online user rat ings on box-office sales and, then, to estimate the economic
values of online user ratings. Hence, our findings can demon strate not only the theoretical importance of online user ratings
but also practical evidence of its importance. To achieve our
goal, we should estimate precisely the effects by carefully
considering potential endogeneity concerns mentioned above.
To meet this requirement, we develop a modeling framework
that exploits the instrumental variable (IV) estimation proce dure and the fixed effects estimation approach in panel data.
In our modeling section, we first propose our post-release
advertising spending model that enables us to identify influential
factors in the post-release-advertising decision. Second, we pro pose our rating models in which users’social and demographic
characteristics are used as instrumental variable for the valence
and volume of user ratings. Finally, our box-office sales model
attempts to estimate the dynamic effects of post-release adver tising and online user ratings using predictions from the models
of advertising spending and the user ratings. We present our
models after discussing our dataset in the next section.

4 Data Description
We used web-scraping techniques to collect data from various
public websites (see Table 2 for data sources) for all movies
released in theaters in the U.S. in 2007. Our dataset contains
information on movie characteristics and box-office perfor mance, and individual level online user reviews. In addition,
the dataset includes weekly advertising spending for each mov ie from Ad$pender.1 From June through November in 2008, we
collected user-level review, demographics and social network ing data for all the movies considered from Flixster.com (See
Table 2), which is the largest social movie site.2 After 2008, the
individual user information from the website was no longer
publicly available. Therefore, integrating sales and post release ad spending data and user review data from Flixster.
com for the movies released in 2007 into a single dataset
provides the best dataset for this study. Like other popular
Social Network Services (SNS) (e.g., Facebook, Twitter or
Yelp), each user can make her own account webpage on
Flixster and manage her online friendship. From users’ profile
pages on Flixster.com, we download all observable information
about the users who have generated at least one movie rating.
Flixster.com also provides information on friendship among
users. Hence, it enables us to obtain individual specific
information such as gender, age, the number of generated
ratings and text reviews, and account status (the number of
profile views by other users and membership duration) on the
website. Also, we can partially observe friendship networks
among users in the site. We considered the intersection of our
movie-level and user-level review datasets. As a result, our
dataset contains 304 movies for which 38,532 Flixster users
have created 76,102 ratings in Flixster.com.
Our data include weekly box-office sales of 304 movies
released in 2007 and each movie ran different number of weeks
in theaters and, hence, our sales data is unbalanced longitudinal
for 304 movies over week runs between 1 to 44 (See Table 3).
For the 304 movies in our sample, weekend box-office sales,
weekly rank of each movie, weekly post-release advertising
spending are all available, and they are time-varying variables.
Also, the total number of theaters and opening week’s number
of theaters, MPAA rating, and running time are observable and
time-invariant variables. We can also observe the posting users’
online profiles in Flixster.com, which convey information
about age, gender, membership period, the number of online
friends, the numbers of ratings and text reviews, the number of
profile page views by others, and the number of friends who
rated the same movies. With the individual level data, we

network television.

833 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
construct the average values of all the variables for each movie,
so that the measures can indicate posting users’ overall
characteristics for a movie’s average rating and the number of
ratings in a week. The measures, however, do not affect box office sales directly as they are overall characteristics of the
audience of a movie, which do not express any quality to po tential consumers. Therefore, the measures can be used as ap propriate instruments in the sales model estimation.
5 Model Overview
Our econometric modeling structure is designed, accurately,
to identify the sales effects of post-release-advertising spend ing and online user ratings created in a social network com munity. It is necessary to obtain unbiased estimates of the
effects since our goal is to evaluate the economic values of
the rating dynamics as a comparable component in the

marketing mix. To specify the model correctly, we should
consider potentially endogenous relationships between sales,
user ratings, and post-release advertising in modeling. In other
words, a movie may show higher sales not necessarily because
of more positive ratings or a greater number of ratings but
rather due to a higher appeal to consumers, which is also
reflected in higher ratings and more ratings (Dellarocas et al.
2010; Moe and Trusov 2011). Also, post-release advertising
campaign can be correlated with the dynamics of sales and
user ratings. We can address these potential endogeneity con cerns by leveraging our unique data, which is longitudinal and
provides instrumental variables from the online characteristics
of rating users in a social network site for movies.
First we develop a post-release advertising model that ex plains post-release advertising spending on a movie over time.
A challenge we face in this modeling effort is that we must
capture both what are related to future box-office sales and
what are unrelated to the box-office sales, which allow us to
determine correctly the effect of post-release advertising
spending on the box-office sales. To address potential bias
stemming from unobserved time-varying variables such as
unobserved marketing and promotional dynamics, we consid er a lag of post-release advertising spending as a valid instru mental variable in our dataset. On average, 90% of advertising
dollars were allocated and spent before the release date
(Elberse and Anand 2007) and studios buy nearly all of their
TVad time during the Bupfront^ marketplace to procure quan tity discounts (Auletta 1992). Hence, studios’ weekly ad
spending after the release date is more likely planned before
the release date in relation to their time-invariant strategic
decisions (e.g., total advertising budget). However, a series
of weekly ad spends can be still determined after the movie
release to boost ticket sales in the following weekend based on
the latest market information available (Rennhoff and Wilbur
2011). As such, a valid instrumental variable would be the
third-order lag of post-release advertising which may greatly
influence the current decision on weekly ad spending and,
however, the impact of ad spending three weeks prior on the
current weekend box-office sales is minimal due to the time
interval and the increasing volatility of later-week revenues
(Dellarocas et al. 2007).3 Furthermore, we can control for
another potential bias caused by unobserved time-invariant
variables (e.g., movie heterogeneity, total prelease ad spend ing, other fixed effects) through our panel dataset.
Likewise, we develop a user ratings model to address a
potential endogenous relationship between box-office sales
and the ratings. A movie with famous actors, directors, and
sequels may cause more fans to produce more positive re views online and the effects of these factors on box-office
sales co-exist with the ratings. The longitudinal aspect of our
data can control for a bias caused by such unobserved time invariant variables using the fixed effects estimation.
However, it is not trivial to control for another bias caused
by unobserved time-varying variables such as the marketing
strategy dynamics, media coverage, and offline word-of mouth, which affect not only sales but also user ratings. We
address this issue also by finding relevant instrumental vari ables in our dataset. Lee et al. (2015) and Moe and Trusov
(2011) argue that social influences, social pressure and indi vidual characteristics can influence the extent of online user
reviews. Hence, such metrics from the posting users in a mov ie review site can be used as a set of instrumental variables,
because, in theory, user characteristics will not directly affect
box-office sales. However, one may argue that a particular
film genre (e.g., animation movies) may appeal more to cer tain consumers (e.g., kids) only and, therefore, the sales of the
movie might be correlated with user characteristics reflecting
user preferences and the level of engagement in the movie
review site. This might not be an issue in our case, because
we control for time-invariant movie characteristics by MPAA
rating, running time and the total number of opening theaters,
and by using the fixed effects estimation.
Finally, in order to assess the sales impacts of the dynamics
on ratings in comparison to the effect of post-release advertis ing, our sales model is specified to capture (1) the effect of post release advertising spending, (2) the effects of valence and vol ume of user ratings, and (3) idiosyncratic error. The model is
evaluated by two stage estimation with relevant instrumental
variables and leveraging our panel data to remove any fixed
error terms in the model. Also, we address the lagged effects of
advertising and online user ratings in sales modeling because
such quality information can be perpetually available on the
Internet, and also potential moviegoers can utilize the informa tion much later than the time of actual decision to see a movie.
5.1 First Stage Models: Weekly Post-Release Advertising
and Online User Ratings
First, we set up a first-stage equation for weekly post-release
advertising spending. A studio commonly plans pre-release
advertising as a fixed portion of the marketing budget based
on movie production and distribution factors, due to quantity
discounts and the upfront marketplace for TV ad time
(Rennhoff and Wilbur 2011). On the contrary, post-release
advertising can be influenced by contemporaneous and envi ronmental factors and the previous period’s performance of
the movie. Therefore, we define the post-release ad spending
for a movie j in week t as
ADSPENDj;t ¼ XAD
j;t βAD þ ZAD
j;t γAD þ αAD
j þ εAD
j;t ; ð1Þ
where XAD
j;t contains factors that can affect a movie j’s post release ad spending in a given week t, and they are time-
3 We do not consider the first (or second) order lag of weekly ad spending or
cumulative ad spending because its effect may still last in the current week.
835 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
varying or time-invariant. ZAD
j;t is a vector of instrumental var iables which are likely correlated with the ad spending of the
week, but not with the gross sales of the movie. XAD
j;t includes
the covariates in our sales model and ZAD
j;t includes a subset of
our instrumental variables such as the third-order lagged
values of ADSPENDj,t. The third-order lagged variable can
be a valid instrumental variable for ADSPENDj,t due to our
focus on modeling box-office sales with post-release ad
spending based on the two stage estimation procedure, and
also because prior ad spending three weeks ago can be linked
to the ad spending decision in the current week. However, the
prior ad spending is unlikely to be correlated with the contem poraneous box-office sales if we take into account the lagged
effect of ADSPEND in our sales model (Jacobson 1990). We
also include a fixed error term αAD
j to control for any unob served fixed effects and an idiosyncratic error term εAD
j;t in this
model.
Similarly, the first-stage equations for the volume of ratings
and the average rating for a movie j in week tsince the movie’s
release are shown in (2) and (3) respectively:
Log NUMRATj;t
  ¼ XVOL
j;t βVOL þ ZVOL
j;t γVOL þ αVOL
j
þ εVOL
j;t ; ð2Þ
AVGRAT j;t ¼ XVAL
j;t βVAL þ ZVAL
j;t γVAL þ αVAL
j þ εVAL
j;t : ð3Þ
In (2) and (3), Xj , t ‘s contain the covariates used in our
sales model and αj ‘s are fixed error terms of movie heteroge neity and εj , t ‘s are idiosyncratic error terms. Zj , t ‘s are the
subset of our instrumental variables which are the measures of
overall characteristics of the users who generated the posted
ratings in Flixster.com until a given week t after the movie is
released. In other words, those instrumental variables
represent the average characteristics of users who have
posted their ratings, which create the values of NUMRATj,t
and AVGRATj,t. Table 3 provides the description of such user
specific variables. Because a user’s social characteristics and
network may also affect the user’s rating (Lee et al. 2015),
aggregated information of the characteristics of the posting
users can be related to the movie’s average user rating and
the number of ratings, aggregated user review metrics.
However, the overall user characteristics are less likely related
to future box-office sales of a movie because rating users’
social network characteristics do not affect box-office sales
but the characteristics may influence the users’ decisions to
submit a rating and the choice of their rating value. We esti mate the equations of (1), (2), and (3) separately and use the
fitted values of the dependent variables from the equations to
estimate our sales model of (4) as the second stage model
estimation (Wooldridge 2010), which we will describe in the
following section.
5.2 Sales Model
With a particular interest in the role of post-release advertising
and user-generated ratings, our weekend box-office sales
model intends to evaluate the factors that may affect movie
performance. Existing studies also have typically
modeled the relationship between box-office perfor mance and user ratings by regressing movie box-office
sales against average rating (Dellarocas et al. 2007) or
the number of ratings (Dellarocas et al. 2007; Duan
et al. 2008; Liu 2006). However, unlike the prior re search, we add a richer set of covariates including ac tual post-release spending on movie advertising and the
longitudinal feature in our dataset provides a successful
way to control for movie heterogeneity. We consider weekend
gross box-office sales as our dependent variable, as the effect
of unobserved factors from the contemporaneous week is min imized in the weekend. We use the following model to de scribe the weekend gross box-office sales earned by movie j
on the weekend in a week t as
Log WKGRj;t
  ¼ Y WG
j;t δWG þ X WG
j;t βWG þ ZWG
j γWG
þ αWG
j þ εWG
j;t ; ð4Þ
where Y WG
j;t contains the week t’s ad spending, the volume of
ratings, and the valence of ratings for movie j and they are
assumed to be endogenous in the model as described earlier.
X WG
j;t is a set of time-varying covariates that influence the
weekend gross box-office sales in a given week t. In the set,
we include a movie’s box-office ranking to control for the
extent of inter-movie competition in the corresponding week,
the number of movie screening weeks and its square term to
allow for nonlinear sales decay (Ainslie et al. 2005), and the
weekly number of theaters showing the movie to control for
the distribution channel changes. ZWG
j includes time-invariant
variables such as runtime, MPAA rating dummies, and open ing week’s number of theaters. αWG
j is movie j’s fixed effects
such as movie heterogeneity, which are unobservable and also
time-invariant. εWG
j;t is an idiosyncratic error term in this sales
model.
5.3 Lagged Effects of Post-release Advertising and Online
User Ratings
Before estimating Eq. (4), we should account for the
lagged effects of advertising and ratings because adver tising and ratings in previous periods may still affect
current week’s movie performance as well. In other
words, advertising and ratings in the current period may attract
new moviegoers, some of whom purchase immediately and
some of whom delay purchase to future periods because of
836 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
shopping and usage rates (Bass and Clarke 1972). Hence, we
introduce the following equation:
Log WKGRj;t
  ¼ βWG
0 þ δWG
1 ADSPENDj;t þ δWG
11 ADSPENDj;t−1 þ δWG
12 ADSPENDj;t−2 þ ⋯
þ δWG
2 Log NUMRAT j;t
  þ δWG
21 Log NUMRAT j;t−1
  þ δWG
22 Log NUMRAT j;t−2
  þ ⋯
þ δWG
3 AVGRAT j;t þ δWG
31 AVGRAT j;t−1 þ δWG
32 AVGRAT j;t−2 þ ⋯ þ X WG
j;t βWG þ ZWG
j γWG þ αWG
j þ εWG
j;t :
ð5Þ
Bass and Clarke (1972) discussed that the relative impact
of current and previous advertising in determining current
sales can then be described by the Koyck (1954) distribution
in which the impact of advertising on sales decays geo metrically with time. Likewise, we further assume that
the effect of ratings (AVGRAT and NUMRAT) ratings as
a form of social media may decline exponentially be cause AVGRAT and NUMRAT vary over time.
Multiplying both sides of (5) by (1-λL),4 (5) can be
rewritten as
Log WKGRj;t
  ¼ βWG
0 1−λ ð Þþ λLog WKGRj;t−1
  þ δWG

ð6Þ
Therefore, with the fitted values of ADSPEND,
Log(NUMRAT) and AVGRAT from (1), (2) and (3), we esti mate (6) using the within group estimator (fixed effects esti mator) eliminating αWG
j which potentially can be correlated
with WKGRj , t − 1. As such, this procedure does not only ac count for the endogeneity stemming from unobserved vari ables and instantaneous causation of the gross sales on our
variables of interest, but also remove the time-invariant movie
heterogeneity, αWG
j .
6 Model Estimations and Results
6.1 Model Specification Test
To correctly specify our sales model, we perform various
specification tests. First, under the strongly restrictive assump tion that the fixed effects αWG
j is orthogonal to our sets of
independent variables, and there are no endogenous regres sors, we first obtain the random effects estimators of (6). A
Lagrangian multiplier test (Breusch and Pagan 1979) fails to
support the null hypothesis that the variance of αWG
j is 0 with
the test statistic 8.44 in Table 4. This statistically indicates that
we have to control for movie heterogeneity in (6). Second, we
relax the orthogonality assumption only and obtain the fixed
effects estimators of (6). The Hausman test (1978) allows us to
examine whether the fixed effects αWG
j would not have dele terious effects on random effect estimates by statistically com paring the estimates of time varying variables in (6) from the
fixed effects estimation and the random effects estimation.
The test statistic of 32.49 in Table 4 rejects that the estimates
are not different and suggests fixed effects techniques are re quired to account for movie heterogeneity. However, the fixed
effects estimation cannot account for the endogeneity stem ming from unobserved time-varying variables and simultane ity in (6). Thus, we first estimate the models of weekly ad
spending (1), volume of user ratings (2), and average rating
(3) with our instrumental variables. Then, we estimate the
sales model (6) by the fixed effect estimation with the fitted
values of ADSPEND, Log(NUMRAT) and AVGRAT. This pro cedure becomes a fixed effects-two stage least square estima tion (FE-2SLS). In the following sections, we discuss the re sults and also the relevance of our instrumental variables.
6.2 Diagnosis of the Endogeneity in the Sales Model
Before we estimate our first stage models by the fixed effects
estimation specifying with appropriate instrumental variables,
we first diagnose the endogenous assumption of our variables
of interest, ADSPEND, NUMRAT, and AVGRAT in (6). For
this purpose, we estimate (6) using FE-2SLS estimator with
4 L is the lag operator and this is the Koyck (1954) transformation.
837 Inf Syst Front (2019) 21:829–844
all the users’ social network characteristic variables
(AVG_DMEMBER, AVG_NUMRE, AVG_NUMFRA,
AVG_AGE, AVG_GENDER, AVG_NUMF),5 and the third order lagged values of ADSPEND as the set of excluded in strumental variables. Then, we can obtain the overall and in dividual test statistics of exogeneity of our variables of interest
(ADSPEND, NUMRAT, and AVGRAT) (Davidson 1995) un der the null hypothesis that an ordinary least squares (OLS)
estimator of the same eq. (6) using the fixed effects estimation
without the instrumental variable would produce consistent
estimates. In the row (1) in Table 5, the test statistic for the
overall exogeneity of all the variables of our interest is 3.97,
and it rejects the null that the variables are exogenous in (6). It
indicates that at least one variable of the variables should be
treated as an endogenous variable in (6). Further, we apply the
test to subsets of the possible combinations of the variables. In
the row (6) in Table 5, the test statistic of 0.099 fails to reject
that the NUMRAT is exogenous in (6). Therefore, statistically
the volume of ratings for the movie is closely related to online
users’ individual characteristics and preferences, rather than
the factors which influence the box-office sales.6 Rationales
for this exogeneity of the volume of ratings in the sales model
can be also justified in theory as follows. Moe and Schweidel
(2012) and Ying et al. (2006) argue online users’ decisions to
post their ratings are contingent on the individuals having 1)
experience with the product, 2) varying baseline tendencies to
submit ratings, 3) the current state of the rating environment at
the time of rating; and 4) post-purchase evaluation. In other
words, the volume of ratings are mainly attributed to the
propensity of user rating participation driven by individual
user characteristics and post-purchase evaluation, not by fac tors driving box-office sales.
In contrary, the individual exogeneity test statistic for
AVGRAT in the row (7) in Table 5 is 6.14, and it rejects the
exogeneity assumption of AVGRAT at the 5% level.
Statistically, it also demonstrates the potentially endogenous
relationship between box-office sales and the valence of rat ings. In other words, a Bgood^ movie is likely to experience
higher sales and receive more positive ratings than a
Bbad^ movie. The consequence is that the box-office
sales and ratings can be correlated to each other, but
the relationship is not necessarily causal (Moe and
Trusov 2011) because of the endogeneity. Similarly, the indi vidual test statistic of 5.77 for ADSPEND in the row (5) in
Table 5 suggests ADSPEND should be considered endoge nous. The overall test statistic of 10.63 for both ADSPEND
and AVGRAT in the row (4) also shows that the two variables
are endogenous in (6). Hence, in our analysis, we assume that
the volume of ratings (NUMRAT) is exogenous and excluded
in the first stage modeling, and both ADSPEND and AVGRAT
are endogenous in (6).
6.3 Results of First Stage Model Estimations
Table 6 provides the parameter estimates resulting from fixed
effects estimation of our first stage models of weekly post release ad spending and the average user ratings. The esti mates in Table 6 can be biased due to potential
misspecifications and also the estimates in the first stage are
merely used to predict the endogenous variables in the sales
model (6). However, it might be worth observing the estimates
to understand the extent of interrelationships among the
variables.
5 AVG_NUMRA and AVG_PROFVare dropped due to their high correlations
with AVG_NUMRE, 0.70 and 0.96 respectively. 6 We also observe statistically significant relationship of this in our sample.
From the first stage estimation for (2), all the variables of social network
characteristics except for AVG_NUMF affect very significantly NUMRAT.
We omitted the result table but it is available upon request.

Most results meet our expectation, and it appears that our
subset of the instrumental variables (ADSPENDjt-3,
AVG_AGEjt, AVG_GENDERjt) is statistically related to the
endogenous variables. The results show that box-office dy namics such as weekly rank and weekly number of theaters
can substantially affect the movie maker’s decision on weekly
post-release ad spending. It is also intriguing that
Log(NUMRAT) is highly significant and has a negative impact
on ADSPEND. This result may indicate that online social
media feeds back into the decision about advertising and the
brand manager opts to advertise less if online social media has
generated sufficient awareness of the product (Clark et al.
2009). The effect of the third-order lagged ADSPEND as an
instrumental variable on ADSPEND is positive and signifi cant. Other results in Table 6 also suggest that an increase in
the movie’s box-office rank (lowly ranked) or the number of
theaters (more distribution channels) tends to encourage mov ie makes to spend more on post-release advertising for their
movies.
In Table 6, we can also find a positive relationship between
the average user rating in a given week and its previous week’s
weekend box-office at the 10% significance level. Also,
WEEKS has a diminishing effect on AVGRAT, which shows
the average user rating does not increase monotonically over
time. Most importantly, the average rating is related to a subset
of overall user characteristic variables (AVG_AGE and
AVG_GENDER are significant at <5% level in the column
of AVGRAT in Table 6), which are used as instrumental vari ables. In other words, the average rating tends to become
lower if there are more older or male posters in that week.

This result is consistent with the finding in Lee et al. (2015)
that provides evidence of demographic and social effects in
sequentially generated online user movie ratings. We also ob serve that the average rating decreases as the number of posted
ratings increases (the estimated parameter for Log(NUMRAT)
in Table 6 is negative and statistically significant). This result
is consistent with the trends documented by Godes and Silva
(2012) and Moe and Trusov (2011). Our results add to their
empirical findings and show that the negative trend may per sist after controlling for overall characteristics of posting
users. However, box-office dynamics (rank and the number
of theaters) and previous ad spending do not appear to affect
significantly the average movie rating. Also, the results from
our first stage model estimations appears to verify the rele vance of overall posting user characteristics and the third order lagged variable of ADSPEND as instrumental variables
by showing their significant relationship with the endogenous
ADSPEND and AVGRAT. Nevertheless, we offer more rigor ous tests for their relevance as instrumental variables after
discussing the results from our box-office sales model.
6.4 The Impact of Post-release Advertising and Online
User Ratings on Future Box-office Sales
Table 7 presents the results of the proposed sales model, which
decomposes online user ratings metrics, ad spending, the dy namics of the variables and box-office sales through the
lagged effects, and error components. In Table 7, we also
present the results for three restrictive models that measure
the effects of ad spending, average rating, the volume of rat ings without any instrumental variables or controlling for
fixed effects. For example, the random effect estimation on
our sales model (6) leads to standard cross-section estimators
which neglect unobserved movie heterogeneity. Thus, if un observed movie time-invariant characteristics are correlated
with ADSPEND, NUMRAT, and AVGRAT, such procedure
will produce inconsistent estimates, which are provided in
the column of RE (between) in Table 7.
Also, the problem with simultaneous equations estimators
in the column of RE-2SLS in Table 7 is that αWG
j also appears
in the reduced form, rendering the instrumental set invalid.
However, by using fixed effects estimator on (6) as a basis
for estimation, this source of endogeneity from the fixed ef fects may be addressed. Therefore, if the only problem is the
correlation between our independent variables and unob served movie heterogeneity, then consistent estimation is pos sible by simply performing fixed effects estimation on (6)
without our instrumental variable approach, and the results
are provided in the column of FE (within) in Table 7.
However, the model may also suffer from conventional simul taneity between the time-varying independent variables and
time-varying error components. The conventional simultane ity can be accounted for by using 2SLS with our proposed first
stage models with the instrumental variables to estimate (6),
where all variables have been subjected to the within transfor mation (Baltagi 2006; Cornwell and Trumbull 1994).
Therefore, FE-2SLS can address the sources of endogeneity
from movie heterogeneity and the simultaneity in the sales
model.
Focusing on our variables of interest, there are remarkable
differences between the results from the restrictive models and
our proposed model in Table 7. In the results of the restrictive

models in Table 7, only the estimated coefficients of
Log(NUMRAT) are positive and statistically significant.
Furthermore, the signs of the estimated coefficients of
ADSPEND and AVGRAT are inconsistent across the different
restrictive models in Table 7. In contrast, the estimated effects
of the previous weekend’s gross sales, rank, and the number of
theaters are fairly consistent across all the models in Table 7,
and their signs meet our expectation.
The column of FE-2SLS in Table 7 reports the estimates
from the fixed effects-two stage least square estimation. By
taking account of both sources of endogeneity, the FE-2SLS
yields the estimated effects of ADSPEND, Log(NUMRAT),
and AVGRAT. We find that the point estimates of other time
varying variables in the column of FE-2SLS in Table 7 are
close to the corresponding estimates in the restrictive models.
More importantly, the estimates of the effects of ADSPEND,
Log(NUMRAT), and AVGRAT in the column of FE-2SLS in
Table 7 are statistically very significant and positive.
Specifically, an increase in ADSPEND appears to be truly
effective in increasing the following weekend box-office sales
(the estimated coefficient is 0.0002 and is significant at the 1%
level). For example, on average and by holding other factors
fixed, $500,000 increases in a week’s ad spending (in 000 s)
provides about a 10.5% increase in the weekend box-office
sales. In order to increase the subsequent weekend’s sales by
the same rate (10.5%), the estimated effect of Log(NUMRAT)
in the column of FE-2SLS in Table 7 (0.1426 and significant
at the 5% level) suggests that the volume of ratings in that
week needs to be doubled, by holding all else fixed. That is,
the volume of ratings generated by users as earned social
media coverage (enhancing consumer awareness) can make
an equivalent effect to the sales impact of ad spending. The
estimated coefficient of AVGRAT by FE-2SLS in Table 7
(0.8359 and significant at the 5% level) also shows that a
0.12 star (on a 10 star scale) increase in the average user rating
in the week can lift up the following weekend box-office sales
by about a 10.5%, when we hold the other independent vari ables constant. Hence, an increase in average user rating can
significantly improve future box-office sales as a comparable
sales impact of post-release advertising. These findings rein force the importance of valence of user ratings (Chevalier and
Mayzlin 2006; Chintagunta et al. 2010) and volume of user
ratings (Dellarocas et al. 2007; Duan et al. 2008) in the
predicting movie box-office performance. Therefore, our
quantitative analysis of the effects of online user ratings on
the box-office sales in comparison with the effect of post release ad spending reveals monetary values of online user
ratings as a variety of social media.
We further consider robustness of the results with respect to
autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. The last column of FE-
2SLS Robust in Table 7 presents the results by taking account
for the first-order auto-correlated and heteroskedastic error
term, and the estimated effects of ADSPEND,
Log(NUMRAT) and AVGRAT are consistently significant. In
the following section, we further evaluate our instrumental
variables used in the above estimations because the results
would be also spurious with irrelevant instrumental variables.
6.5 The Relevance of Instrumental Variables
Although we explained rationales for the relevance of our
instrumental variables in the previous sections, we can statis tically test the relevance and exogeneity of the instrumental
variables with our dataset. First, weak identification arises
when the instruments are correlated with the endogenous var iables (ADSPEND and AVGRAT), but only weakly. Weak in strumental variables provide large variances of estimates as
well as potentially severe finite-sample bias. With techniques
discussed in Nelson and Startz (1990), we can diagnose weak
instrument variables (IV) based on the F-test for the joint
significance of the IV’s. In Table 8, F-tests of the null hypoth esis that the joint effect of our IV’s is zero lead to the test statistics with the values of just 9.94 in (1) and 3.19 in (3).
Also, the F-test by Angrist and Pischke (Kmenta 2010) pro vides the similar values of the statistics in Table 8. The tests
reject the null and this confirms the joint effect of our IV’s is
statistically significant in the first stage models describing
ADSPEND and AVGRAT. Also, the chi-square tests of the null
hypothesis that the specific endogenous variable in the sales
model is unidentified lead to the test-statistics with the values
of 60.42 in (1) and 22.47 in (3), which reject the null hypoth esis. Therefore, we can conclude that our instrumental vari ables are Brelevant^, meaning that the instrumental variables
are correlated with the endogenous variables.
Second, our model must be overidentified, meaning that
more instrument variables than endogenous variables in the
model. Because endogenous IV’s lead inconsistency of the
estimated coefficients of the endogenous variables
(ADSPEND and AVGRAT in our model), we need to test the
joint null hypothesis that our instrumental variables are uncor related with the error term, and our instrumental variables are
correctly excluded from the estimated sales equation. Under
the null, the Hansen’s J test statistic, which is distributed as
chi-squared, is 4.334, and we cannot reject the null (Hayashi

2000). This result indicates that we have more exogenous
variables than endogenous variables in our two stage regres sion procedure. Also, a regression based overidentification
test which regresses residuals from FE-2SLS of (6) on our
entire instrument variables also pass jointly and individually
the requirements.7 Therefore, we could also show statistically
that the results in Table 8 are not deteriorative with our instru ment variables.
7 Discussion
In an agreement with previous studies (Chevalier and Mayzlin
2006; Chintagunta et al. 2010; Dellarocas et al. 2007; Godes
and Silva 2012; Li and Hitt 2008; Moe and Trusov 2011;
Stephen and Galak 2012), our study provides evidence that
consumer generated product ratings can have direct effects on
product sales, using movie as the product of interest.
However, few researchers have examined the effects with
the dynamics of marketing mix. We explicitly consider ad
spending on movies and online user reviews from a social
network site for the movies. To examine the sales impacts of
the reviews with the comparable effect of ad spending, we
outline potential difficulties in measuring those effects with
our data including ad spending, reviews, and sales of movies.
Then, we discuss how having reviewers’ demographics and
characteristics in the online social network site for movie can
alleviate some issues with the variables of reviews, ad spend ing and box-office sales. We then provide an empirical appli cation for our proposed fixed-effects two stage regression ap proach to measuring the box-office sales impact of ad spend ing and the valence and volume of online user ratings from
Flixster.com while accounting for the potential biases. Our
identification strategy is justifiable with our valid
instruments for user ratings by exploiting reviewing users’
online characteristics including friendships in Flixster.com
since user ratings can reflect users’ own characteristics,
which do not influence subsequent box-office sales. In addi tion, the longitudinal structure of our dataset enables us to
effectively address unobserved movie heterogeneity in our
analysis. Our econometric model approach is simple and use ful in investigating the effectiveness of ad and online reviews
on sales and specification testing without imposing too much
structure. Nevertheless, further research could investigate dy namic ad and online reviews over sequential distribution chan nels with a more structural approach, because strategic inter actions between traditional marketing and social media mar keting affect firms’ decision rules themselves (Chintagunta
et al. 2006).
We find that the valence and volume of online user
ratings have a significant and positive impact on box office earnings. The importance of the valence or vol ume of online user ratings have been documented by
past research in other contexts as well (Chevalier and
Mayzlin 2006; Chintagunta et al. 2010; Dellarocas et al.
2007; Duan et al. 2008). One novel finding to the lit erature studying the economic impact of online user
reviews is showing the importance of both valence and
volume of user ratings in predicting movie box-office
sales after accounting for the dynamics of post-release
ad spending. Hence, our analysis adds another support
for the significant impact of both valence and volume of
online user ratings on product performance (Bruce et al.
2012), whereas some others advocate the valence effect
only (Chintagunta et al. 2010; Gopinath et al. 2014).
Our analysis also extends the dynamic impact of online
user reviews from the static pre-release ad spending
(Chintagunta et al. 2010) to the impact’s relation to
the dynamic post-release advertising, and eventually
we can compare the contemporaneous advertising effect
on box-office sales to the effect of consumer-generated
(earned) media.
Our results may provide useful insights about earned
social media strategy to movie distributors and studios.
First, movie distributors and studios can use these re sults to help them evaluate their current and future mar keting strategy with respect to earned social media and
owned social media. Because more earned social media
(regardless of positivity or negativity) from customers
can have the same effect of owned media (advertising)
after a movie is released, finding a way to increase the
volume of online customer ratings may be more cost effective than spending on traditional media. For exam ple, distributors and studios can focus more on using
online social network sites to advertise their movies in
a way which stimulates more users to post ratings.
Additionally, games or contests that involved social me dia such as twitter posts with hashtags about the movie
might increase visibility of the movie within communi ties of consumers that typically would post ratings.
Second, similarly, promoting an adequate number of
users to provide more positive ratings can be a profit able strategy since a relatively small increase in average
rating can significantly affect the sales.
Overall, online user ratings are a type of social media
which can significantly convey quality information to poten tial users, and also enhance awareness of a product within
consumer networks. Although firms have traditionally used
conventional channels for these purposes, it is now critical
for firms to find a rollout marketing plan with earned social
media which can be more cost-effective to accomplish the
equivalent effect of large money spending on advertising.
