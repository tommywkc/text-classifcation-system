From modernism to the movies:The globalization
of american culture in the 20 century
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon,there was -as we all know-an outpouring of sympathy
in Europe and elsewhere for the United States.But since the beginning
of 2002,this international affection has been replaced by resentment at
America's political“arrogance,”its overwhelming economic and mili tary power,and the Bush administration's apparent“unilateralist"for- eign policy. Americans like to think that “they”hate“us”because of who we are, rather than what we do.Yet neither formulation may explain the resur- gence of global anti-Americanism.Dislike for the United States stems
also from what foreigners consider America's cultural“hegemony.” America's mass culture,in particular,inspires ambivalence,anger,and
sometimes violent reactions,not just in the Middle East but all over the
world. There is no doubt that America often seems to be the elephant in
everyone's living room.But the discomfort with America's cultural
dominance is not new.In 1901,the British writer William Stead pub lished a book called,ominously,The Americanization of the World.The
title captured a set of apprehensions -about the disappearance of na tional languages and traditions,the decline of intellectual and artistic
standards,and the obliteration of a country's unique“identity"under the
weight of American habits and states of mind -that persists until today. When people in other countries worried in the past,as they do in the
present,about the intermational impact of American culture,they were
not thinking of America's literature,painting,or ballet.“Americaniza tion”has always meant the worldwide invasion of American movies, jazz,rock and roll,mass circulation magazines,best-selling books,ad- vertising,comic strips,theme parks,shopping malls,fast food,televi- sion programs,and now the Internet.This is,in the eyes of many for- eigners,a culture created not for patricians but for the common folk. Indeed,it inspired a revolution in the way we conceive of culture. More recently,globalization has become the main enemy for aca- demics,journalists,and political activists who loathe what they see as
the trend toward cultural uniformity.Still,they typically regard global

culture and American culture as synonymous.And they continue to
insist that Hollywood,McDonald's,and Disneyland are eradicating
regional and local eccentricities -disseminating images and subliminal
messages so beguiling as to drown out the competing voices in other
lands. Despite these allegations,the cultural relationship between the
United States and the world over the past 100 years has never been one- sided.On the contrary,the United States was,and continues to be,as
much a consumer of foreign intellectual and artistic influences as it has
been a shaper of the world's entertainment and tastes.What I want to
emphasize,therefore,is how reciprocal America's cultural connections
with other countries really are. That is not an argument with which many foreigners (or even many
Americans)would readily agree.The clichés about American's cultural “imperialism”make it difficult for most people to recognize that modern
global culture is hardly a monolithic entity foisted on the world by the
American media.Neither is it easy for critics of Microsoft or AOL Time
Warner to acknowledge that the conception of a harmonious and distinc tively American culture-encircling the globe,implanting its values in
foreign minds-has always been a myth. Nevertheless,the United States has been a recipient as much as an
exporter of global culture.Indeed,immigrants from Europe,Asia,Latin
America,and increasingly the Middle East,as well as African- Americans and the thousands of refugee scholars and artists who fled
Hitler in the 1930s,have played a crucial role in the development of
American science,literature,movies,music,painting,architecture,fash ion,and food. It is precisely these foreign influences that have made America's cul ture so popular for so long in so many places.American culture spread
throughout the world because it has habitually drawn on foreign styles
and ideas.Americans have then reassembled and repackaged the cultural
products they received from abroad,and retransmitted them to the rest
of the planet.In effect,Americans have specialized in selling the fanta- sies and folklore of other people back to them.This is why a global mass
culture has come to be identified,however simplistically,with the
United States. There are other reasons,of course,for the international popularity of
American culture.Certainly,the ability of America's media conglomer- ates to control the production and distribution of their products has been
a major stimulus for the worldwide spread of American entertainment.
36 Richard Pells Moreover,the emergence of English as a global language has been
essential to the acceptance of American culture.One billion people on
the planet,at the beginning of the 21st century,speak some form of
English.People who have learned English as a foreign language now
outnumber those who are native speakers. Yet more significant than its diffusion around the world is the effec tiveness of English (unlike German,Russian,Chinese,or even French
and Italian)as a language of mass communications.Its simpler structure
and grammar along with its tendency to use shorter,less abstract words
and more concise sentences are all advantageous for the composers of
song lyrics,ad slogans,cartoon captions,newspaper headlines,and
movie and TV dialogue.English is thus a language exceptionally well- suited to the demands of American mass culture. Another factor contributing to the globalization of American culture
is the size of the American audience.From the 1920s on,America's
artists and entertainers have benefited from a huge domestic market. This market has provided an economic cushion for the producers of
American mass culture,a cushion unavailable in many other countries. The possibility that American filmmakers and television executives
could retrieve most of their production costs and make a profit within
the borders of the United States in turn encouraged them to spend more
money on stars,sets,special effects,location-shooting,and merchandis ing-the very ingredients that attract international audiences as well. But the power of American capitalism,the worldwide familiarity
with English,and the economic advantages of a large home market do
not by themselves account for America's cultural ascendancy.American
entertainment has always been more cosmopolitan than"imperialistic."
It is this cosmopolitanism that helped make America's mass culture a
global phenomenon. In short,the familiar artifacts of American culture may not be all that “American.”Americans,after all,did not invent fast food,amusement
parks,or the movies.Before the Big Mac,there were fish-and-chips, worst stands,and pizzas.Before Disneyland there was Copenhagen's
Tivoli Gardens(which Walt Disney used as a prototype for his first
theme park in Anaheim,a model later re-exported to Tokyo and Paris). Nor can the roots of American popular culture be traced only to na tive entertainers like P.T.Barnum or Buffalo Bill.Its origins lay as well
in the European modernist assault,in the opening years of the 20 cen tury,on 19-century literature,music,painting,and architecture -par ticularly in the modernists'refusal to honor the traditional boundaries
between high and low culture.Modernism in the arts was improvisa-

tional,eclectic,and irreverent.These traits have also been characteristic
of,but not peculiar to,mass culture. The hallmark of 19-century culture was its insistence on defending
the purity of literature,classical music,and representational painting
against the intrusions of folklore and popular amusements.No one con fused Tolstoy with dime novels,opera with Wild West Shows,the Lou- vre with Coney Island.High culture was supposed to be educational, contemplative and uplifting -a way of preserving the best in human
“civilization.” These beliefs didn't mean that a Dickens never indulged in melo- drama or that Brahms disdained the use of popular songs.Nor did Chi- nese or Japanese authors and painters refuse to draw on oral or folkloric
traditions.But the 19-century barriers between high and low culture
were resolutely,if imperfectly,maintained. The artists of the early 20 century shattered what seemed to them
the artificial demarcation between different cultural forms.They also
questioned the notion that culture was primarily a means of intellectual
or moral improvement.They did so by valuing style and craftsmanship
over philosophy,religion,or ideology.Hence,they deliberately called
attention to language in their novels,to optics in their paintings,to the
materials in and function of their architecture,to the structure of music
instead of its melodies. And they wanted to shock their audiences.Which they succeeded in
doing.Modern painting and literature -with its emphasis on visually
distorted nudes,overt sexuality,and meditations on violence -was at tacked for being degrading and obscene,and for appealing to the baser
instincts of humanity in much the same way that critics would later
denounce the vulgarity of popular culture. Although modernism assaulted the conventions of 19 century high
culture in Europe and Asia,it inadvertently accelerated the growth of
mass culture in the United States.Indeed,Americans were already re- ceptive to the blurring of cultural boundaries.In the 19*century,sym- phony orchestras in the United States often included band music in their
programs,while opera singers were asked to perform both Mozart and
Stephen Foster, So,for Americans in the 20*century,Surrealism,with its dreamlike
associations,easily lent itself to the wordplay and psychological sym- bolism of advertising,cartoons,and theme parks.Dadaism ridiculed the
snobbery of elite cultural institutions,and reinforced instead an already- existing appetite(especially among the immigrant audiences in Amer ica)for“low-class,”disreputable,movies and vaudeville shows.Stra-
38 Richard Pells vinsky's experiments with atonal (and thus unconventional and unme lodic)music validated the rhythmic innovations of jazz.Writers like
Ermest Hemingway and John Dos Passos,detesting the rhetorical embel lishments of i9-century prose and fascinated by the stylistic innova tions of Joyce and Proust(among other European masters),invented a
terse and hard-boiled language,devoted to reproducing as authentically
as possible the elemental qualities of personal experience.This laconic
style became a model for modern journalism,detective fiction,and
movie dialogue. All ofthese trends provided the foundations for a genuinely new cul ture.But the new culture turned out to be neither modernist nor Euro- pean.Instead,America transformed what was still an avant-garde and
somewhat parochial project,appealing largely to the young and the
rebellious in Western society,into a global enterprise. This cultural metamorphosis is striking in literature.Hemingway, Dos Passos,and William Faulkner may have been captivated in the
1920s by European modernism.But the raw power of their prose and
their ability to dramatize the sensation of living in a world of absurdity
in turn became enormously popular with Italian novelists and literary
critics in the 1930s who were disgusted with Mussolini's bombast,and
with writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus after World War II
who wanted to puncture the bourgeois stuffiness of French life.Thus, American literature,initially molded by European ideas,became a tem- plate for world literature in the second half of the 20*century. The propensity of Americans to borrow and alter modernist ideas, and transform them into a global culture,is even more visible in the
commercial uses of modern architecture.The European Bauhaus move- ment-intended in the 1920s as a socialist experiment in working-class
housing-eventually provided the theories and techniques for the con- struction of commercial skyscrapers and vacation homes in the United
States.But the same architectural ideas were then sent back to Europe
after World War II as a model for the reconstruction of bombed-out
cities like Rotterdam,Cologne,and Frankfurt.Thus,the United States
converted what had once been a distinctive,if localized,rebellion by
Dutch and German architects into a generic “international style.”Simi larly,the American abstract expressionists of the 1940s were heavily
influenced by European refugee painters,sculptors,and art dealers,yet
their work became -at least for a time -the world's most dominant
form of art. But it is in popular culture that America's embrace and reshaping of
foreign influences can best be seen.The American audience is not only
From Modemism to the Movies 39
large;because of the influx of immigrants and refugees,it is also inter- national in its complexion.The heterogeneity of America's population its regional,ethnic,religious,and racial diversity-forced the media, from the early years of the 20*century,to experiment with messages, images,and story lines that had a broad multicultural appeal.The Hol lywood studios,the mass-circulation magazines,and the television net- works had to learn how to speak to a variety of groups and classes at
home.This has given them the techniques to captivate an equally di- verse audience abroad.The American domestic market has,in essence, been a laboratory,a place to develop cultural products that could then be
adapted to the world market. One important way that the American media succeeded in tran- scending internal social divisions,national borders,and language barri- ers was by mixing up cultural styles.American musicians and compos- ers have followed the example of modernist artists like Picasso and
Braque by intermingling elements from high and low culture,combining
the sacred and the profane.Aaron Copland,George Gershwin,and Leo- nard Bermstein incorporated folk melodies,religious hymns,blues and
gospel songs,and jazz into their symphonies,concertos,operas,and
ballets.Bemstein's West Side Story,for instance,transformed Shake- speare's Romeo and Juliet into a saga of juvenile gang warfare on the
streets of New York,just as Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe con- verted Shaw's Pygmalion into My Fair Lady-perhaps the most com- mercially successful,and certainly the wittiest,of all American musical
comedies.Even an art as quintessentially American as jazz evolved
during the 20 century into an amalgam of African,Caribbean,Latin
American,and modernist European music.It is this blending of forms in
America's mass culture that has enhanced its appeal to multi-ethnic
domestic and international audiences by reflecting their varied experi- ences and tastes. Nowhere are these foreign influences more unmistakable than in the
American movie industry.If movies have been the most important
source both of art and entertainment in the 20*century,then Hollywood
-for better or worse -became the cultural capital of the modern world. But it was never an exclusively American capital.Like past cultural
centers-Florence,Paris,Vienna,Berlin -Hollywood has functioned as
an international community,built by immigrant entrepreneurs,and
drawing on the talents of actors,directors,writers,cinematographers, editors,costume and set designers,from all over the world.The first
American movie star,after all,was Charlie Chaplin,whose comic skills
were honed in British music halls.
40 Richard Pells Moreover,during much of the 20*century,American movie- makers thought of themselves as acolytes,entranced by the superior
works of foreign directors.In the 1920s,few American directors could
gain admittance to a European pantheon that included Sergei Eisenstein, F.W.Murnau,G.W.Papst,Fritz Lang,and Carl Dreyer.The postwar
years,from the 1940s to the mid-1960s,were once again a golden age of
filmmaking in Britain,Sweden,France,Italy,Japan,and India.An ex traordinary generation of foreign directors-Ingmar Bergman,Frederico
Fellini,Michelangelo Antonioni,Francois Truffaut,Jean-Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa,and Satyajit Ray-became the world's most celebrated
auteurs. Of course,the French directors learned much of their craft by watch ing and analyzing Hollywood Westerns and gangster movies,copying
the American tough-guy style in films like Godard's Breathless and
Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player.Nevertheless,it is one of the para- doxes of the postwar European and Asian cinema that its greatest suc- cess was in spawning American imitations -another example of how
these cultural transmissions and influences resemble a hall of mirrors. After the release in 1967 of Bonnie and Clyde(originally to have
been directed by Truffaut or Godard),the newest geniuses -Francis
Ford Coppola,Martin Scorsese,Robert Altman,Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen -were American.The Americans may have owed their
improvisational methods and autobiographical preoccupations largely to
Italian neo-Realism and the French News Wave.But who in any country
needed to see another La Dolce Vita when you could now enjoy Nash- ville?Why try to decipher Jules and Jim or L'Avventura when you could
savor Annie Hall or The Godfather?Wasn't it conceivable that The
Seven Samurai might not be as powerful or as disturbing a movie as The
Wild Bunch?
It turmed out that foreign filmmakers had been too influential for
their own good.The Americans used the techniques they absorbed from
the European and Asian auteurs to revolutionize the American cinema, so that after 1960s and 1970s it became harder for any other continent's
film industry to match the worldwide popularity of American movies. Still,American directors in every era have emulated foreign artists
and filmmakers by paying close attention to the formal qualities of a
movie,and to the need to tell a story visually.Early 20-century Euro- pean painters wanted their viewers to recognize that they were looking
at lines and color on a canvass rather than at a reproduction of the natu ral world.Similarly,many American films-from the multiple narrators
in Citizen Kane,to the split screen portrait of how two lovers imagine
From Modenism to the Movies 41
their relationship in Annie Hall,to the flashbacks and flash-forwards in
Pulp Fiction,to the roses blooming from the navel of Kevin Spacey's
fantasy dream girl in American Beauty-deliberately remind the audi- ence that it is watching a carefully-crafted,highly stylized movie,not a
play or a photographed version of reality.Thus,American filmmakers
(in the movies as well as on MTV)have been willing to use the most
sophisticated techniques of editing and camera work,much of it inspired
by foreign directors,to create a modernist collage of images that cap tures the speed and seductiveness of life in the contemporary world. Hollywood's addiction to modernist visual pyrotechnics is particu larly evident in the nonverbal style of many of its contemporary per formers.The tendency to mumble was not always in vogue.In the 1930s
and 1940s,the sound and meaning of words were important not only in
movies but also on records and the radio.Even though some homegrown
stars,like John Wayne and Gary Cooper,were famously terse,audiences
could at least hear and understand what they were saying.But the cen trality of language in the films of the 1930s led more often to a depend- ence in Hollywood on British actors (like Cary Grant)or on Americans
who sounded vaguely British (like Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis). It is illustrative of how important foreign (especially British)talent was
to Hollywood that the two most famous Southern belles in American
fiction and drama -Scarlett O'Hara and Blanche DuBois -were both
played in the movies by Vivien Leigh. Indeed,foreign voices of all types were in great demand.This is,in
part,why Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo were such charismatic stars
in the 1930s.And why-in one of the most famous Hollywood films, Casablanca -every actor except for Humphrey Bogart and Dooley
Wilson(who played Sam the piano player)was an emigré or a refugee
from Europe,including the Hungarian director Michael Curtiz. But the verbal eloquence of pre-World War II acting,in the movies
and the theater,disappeared after 1945.After Marlon Brando's revolu tionary performance in A Streetcar Named Desire,onstage in 1947 and
on screen in 1951,the model of American acting became a brooding, almost inarticulate,introspectiveness that one doesn't find in the glib
and clever heroes or heroines of the screwball comedies and gangster
films ofthe 1930s. Brando was trained in the Method,an acting technique originally de- veloped in Stanislavsky's Moscow Art theater in pre-revolutionary Rus- sia,and then imported to New York by the members of the Group Thea ter during the 1930s.Where British actors,trained in Shakespeare,were
taught to subordinate their personalities to the role as written,the
42 Richard Pells Method encouraged actors to improvise,to summon up childhood
memories,and to explore their innermost feelings,often at the expense
of what a playwright or screenwriter intended.Norman Mailer once said
that Brando,in his pauses and his gazes into the middle distance,always
seemed to be searching for a better line than the one the writer had com- posed.In effect,what Brando did,in the movies even more than on
Broadway,was to lead a revolt-carried on by his successors and imita tors,from James Dean to Warren Beatty to Robert De Niro-against the
British school of acting with its reverence for the script and the written
(and spoken)word. Thus,since World War Il,the emotional power of American acting
lay more in what was not said,in the unearthing of passions that could
not be communicated in words.The Method actor's reliance on physical
mannerisms and even on silence in interpreting a role has been espe- cially appropriate for a cinema that puts a premium on the inexpressible. Indeed,the influence of the Method,not only in the United States but
also abroad(where it was reflected in the acting styles of Jean-Paul
Belmondo and Marcello Mastroianni),is a classic example of how a
foreign idea,originally intended for the stage,was adapted in postwar
America to the movies,and then conveyed to the rest of the world as a
paradigm for both cinematic and social behavior.More important,the
Method's disregard for language permitted global audiences -even
those not well-versed in English -to understand and appreciate what
they were watching in American films. Just as American filmmakers borrowed modernist ideas and prac tices,and relied heavily on foreign talent,the notorious commercialism
of Hollywood movies and of American popular culture in general is
hardly peculiar to the United States.Picasso cared as much about the
prices for his paintings,and Brecht about the number of people who
came to his plays,as Louis B.Mayer did about the box office receipts
for his movies and Walt Disney about the ratings of his television show
or the profits at his theme parks. On both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific,however,the hunger for a
hit and the fear of commercial failure -and the effort therefore to estab lish an emotional connection with and enthrall an audience -have occa- sionally resulted in works that are original and provocative.No matter
where they came from,the greatest directors -Charlie Chaplin,Orson
Welles,Alfred Hitchcock,John Ford,Howard Hawks,Federico Fellini, François Truffaut,Francis Ford Coppola,Martin Scorsese,Steven Spiel- berg-have always recognized the intimate connection between art and
entertainment.To quote Woody Allen,the American filmmaker who is
From Modernism to the Movies 43
who is supposed to have the most pronounced“European”sensibility: “The audience has a right,when they sit down,to be entertained.No
matter how intelligent your message,no matter smart or wonderful [or]
progressive your ideas are,if they are not entertaining they should not be
in a movie.”
In these instances,the requirements of the market and the urge to en tertain have both served as stimulants for art.Hence,there may be no
inherent contradiction between commerce and culture either in America
or abroad.On the contrary,for the creators of high and mass culture
alike,the relationship has often been symbiotic. Finally,American culture has imitated not only the modernists'vis- ual flamboyance,but also their emphasis on personal expression rather
than on the delivery of social messages.The psychological,as opposed
to political,preoccupations of America's mass culture may have ac- counted,more than any other factor,for the worldwide popularity of
American entertainment.American movies,in particular,have custom- arily focused on human relationships and private feelings,not on the
problems of a particular time and place.They tell tales about romance, intrigue,success,failure,moral conflicts,and survival.The most memo rable movies of the 1930s(with the exception of The Grapes of Wrath)
were comedies and musicals about mismatched people falling in love, not socially conscious films dealing with the issues of poverty and un- employment.Similarly,the finest movies about World War II(Casa- blanca)or the Vietnam War(The Deer Hunter)linger in the mind long
after these conflicts have ended because they explored their characters’ deepest emotions instead of dwelling on headline events. Such intensely personal dilemmas are what people everywhere wres tle with.So Europeans,Asians,and Latin Americans flocked to Titanic
(as they once did to Gone With the Wind)not because these films cele- brated“American”values,but because audiences -no matter where
they lived-could see some part of their own lives reflected in the sto ries of love and loss. America's mass culture has often been witless,crude,and intrusive, as its critics -from American academics like Benjamin Barber to Ger- man directors like Wim Wenders -have always complained.In their
eyes,American culture is“colonizing”everyone's subconscious,reduc ing us all to passive residents of “MeWorld.” But American culture has never felt all that foreign to foreigners,not
even in the Middle East.Just the opposite,at its best it has transformed
what it received from others into a culture everyone everywhere could
comprehend and embrace (if they did not always love),a culture that is
44 Richard Pells
-at least some of the time -both emotionally and artistically compel ling for millions of people throughout the world. So,despite the current hostility to America's policies and values - not only in the Middle East but in Europe and Latin America as well-it
is important to recognize how familiar much of American culture seems
to people abroad.In the end,America's mass culture has not trans formed the world into a replica of the United States.Instead,the ethnic
and racial pluralism of American society,together with its dependence
on foreign cultural influences,has made the United States a replica of
the world. If Americans have mostly adopted and reshaped the artistic traditions
of Europeans and others,if the cultural relationship between America
and the rest of the world has not been as one-sided as foreigners usually
insist,and if global entertainment is in fact an artistic and intellectual
smorgasbord,are people outside the United States really losing respect
for their native cultures?
There is no doubt that America's culture is visible everywhere.But
the ubiquitous presence of Coca-Cola billboards and fast-food chains is
only a superficial sign of America's global influence.None of this has
affected how people actually live,shop,eat,think about the role of their
govemments,use their cities,or entertain themselves in neighborhood
cafes or in the privacy of their homes. In reality,the effect of America's culture and consumer goods has
been more negligible than intellectuals,politicians,and parents worried
about the malleability of their Nike-clad children are willing to admit. Eating a Big Mac,lining up for the newest Hollywood blockbuster,or
going to Disneyland in Paris or Tokyo doesn't automatically mean that
one has become either“Americanized”or a compliant inhabitant of the
global village.The purchase of a Chicago Bulls T-shirt by a Brazilian
adolescent or the decision of a German family to have dinner at the
nearby Pizza Hut does not necessarily signify an embrace of the Ameri- can or the global way of life.Sometimes,to paraphrase Freud,a ham- burger is just a hamburger,not an instrument of cultural or ideological
seduction.And neither the movies nor the Internet compel people to
wear the same clothes,listen to the same music,idolize the same screen
heroes,speak the same language,or think the same thoughts. Nor are audiences-either adolescent or adult -a collection of zom- bies,spellbound by the images transmitted by the global media.Intellec tuals often overestimate the power of mass culture to manipulate the
masses.People in America and abroad are affected not just by the media
but by their genes,their childhoods,their parents,their spouses and
From Modemism to the Movies 45
friends,by their experiences at work and their problems at home.These
varied influences enable people to resist or at least reinterpret the me- dia's messages rather than silently submit.Hence,far from being docile, audiences have adapted global culture to their own tastes and traditions. Still,the critics of globalization presume that unwary audiences,re- gardless of their dissimilar social backgrounds and life histories,will
react to movies,television programs,and music in the same way.But
given the volatility of the market and the shifing preferences of the
audience,the American media has prospered by remaining competitive
and eclectic,offering a multiplicity of icons and viewpoints that have
different meanings for different groups at different times in different
countries. Dallas,for example,was the most popular television show in the
world during the 1980s.But studies of audience reactions to the program
demonstrated that people in Holland interpreted the melodramatic lives
of the Ewings very differently than audiences in Israel -or in America. These divergent interpretations were shaped almost entirely by the dis tinctive cultural assumptions and expectations of viewers in disparate
parts of the world.Such dissimilar responses to the same television soap
opera suggest that global entertainment has produced not a homogenous
or a monocultural world,but a reinforcement of cultural diversity. If anything,the globalization of mass communications sometimes
leads not to cultural uniformity but to cultural fragmentation.The shared
cultural experience that came from watching one or two television chan- nels,or seeing movies with hundreds of others in a movie theater,has
given way to multiple choices among hundreds of TV programs broad- cast on satellite and cable stations,to family decisions about when to
watch a movie or a television program on their VCR's or DVD's,and to
more and more time spent by individuals on computers and the Internet. With these devices,we may be connected to the world,but often in our
own way and at our own time,according to our own specific desires. English,for instance,may have spread throughout the world but it
has not thereby become a universal language,understood in the same
way by everyone everywhere.Instead,millions of non-native speakers
add their own words and meanings,creating a hybrid language that is
less a reflection of British or American culture than one rooted in local
needs. Moreover,the critics of the international media conglomerates may
have misjudged the ability of national,regional,local and ethnic cultures
to survive and even to flourish in an age of globalization.The growth of
regionalism,for example,is reflected not only in the Islamic resistance
46 Richard Pells
to and even hatred of “Western”values,but in the tendency of different
countries to export their own culture to neighboring lands.Mexico and
Brazil transmit their films and television soap operas to other countries
in Latin America.Sweden remains the dominant culture in Scandinavia. Egyptian and Indian movies are popular in other parts of the Middle
East and Central Asia.The Hong Kong film industry is a major force in
the East Asian market.At the same time,Argentina can look to France, Brazil to Africa,Chile to Spain,Mexico to its indigenous Indian lan- guage and history,for cultural alternatives to the United States. Australia is a classic example of these regional forces at work.Until
1945,the dominant “foreign”culture in Australia was British.After- wards,American popular culture became increasingly influential.But in
the last two decades,as Australia has developed closer economic ties
with the countries of the Pacific rim,and admitted larger numbers of
immigrants from Vietnam,China,and Japan,Australians have begun to
see themselves increasingly as a multicultural society -part European, part British,part American,and part Asian.In fact,the Australian ex- perience illustrates the degree to which global culture has been eclectic
rather than homogeneous,a culture made up of elements from many
different countries and continents. Finally,the movie and television industries in other countries are
starting once again to capture the attention of local audiences.German
television viewers increasingly favor dramas and situation comedies
made in Germany.In Poland,which was inundated with American mov ies after the collapse of the Communist regime in 1989,several locally- produced films have attracted more ticket buyers than did Titanic or Star
Wars:The Phantom Menace. Nonetheless,filmmakers in Europe and Asia have justifiably grum- bled since the 1970s that they cannot get their works shown in the
United States.For this,they blame Hollywood's monopoly on distribu tion,and the alleged loathing of American audiences for movies that are
subtitled or dubbed.Yet some foreign language films -particularly in
the past decade -have been surprisingly successful and influential in the
United States.These include Italian movies like Cinema Paradiso,Il
Postino,and Life is Beauliful;Run Lola Run which is the most success ful German film ever released in America;and Crouching Tiger,Hidden
Dragon,which was the first foreign language film since Ingmar Berg- man's Cries and Whispers in 1973 to be nominated for an Oscar for best

ity and profitability of foreign films among general audiences in the
United States should remind us that it has never been just college stu- dents and elite film critics who admire works that come from abroad. None of these tendencies point to globalism's imminent demise.In- stead,they raise a dilemma for millions of citizens in every country. How do we live in a global culture(whose elements are not exclusively
American)while at the same time preserving our attachments to a
neighborhood,a town,a region,or a nation?
One answer is that people in the future might have to maintain a dual
set of allegiances -one to their local or national traditions and institu tions,the other to an international culture.These multiple identities and
divided loyalties can be paralyzing.And they can also lead,as we've
been recently and tragically reminded,to a fanatical and totalitarian
rejection of modernity. Yet they may also be liberating because people can decide which
cultural influences they allow at any moment into their lives.Given the
innumerable and often competing cultural influences with which we all
live daily,we have no choice except to choose. In the end,neither foreigners nor Americans have been passive re- ceptacles for Hollywood movies or MTV;we are all free to choose what
to embrace and what to ignore.Recognizing this may enable people in
the 21*century to live more comfortably in what is,for all the argu- ments about “Americanization”and the fears of “globalization,”still a
decidedly pluralistic world.
