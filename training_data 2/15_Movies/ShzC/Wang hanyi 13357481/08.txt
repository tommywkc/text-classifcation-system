The Power of Movies
OR MUCH OF ITS HISTORY,film theory has been obsessed
with various notions of realism.In what has come to be called
classical film theory,i.e.,flm theory until r96s,the writings of
André Bazin evince the extreme form of this obsession.Bazin held
that the film image was an objective re-presentation of the past,a
veritable slice of reality.'In addition to this view of the ontology of
film,Bazin also advanced the psychological corollary that spectators
somehow regard the images on screen as identical with their refer- ents.Contemporary film theorists reject Bazin's metaphysics concern ing the nature of the film image;influenced by semiotics,such
theorists deny there is any literal sense to be made ofthe idea that film
is some kind of natural mirror onto reality.Yet contemporary film
theorists do hold onto a portion of the realist approach,notably its
psychological presuppositions.That is,contemporary theorists,while
rejecting the notion that film is a slice of reality,nevertheless agree
that in its standard uses,film imparts a realistic effect to its viewers. This effect,a psychological effect,is described by various formulas, including the notions that film gives the impression of reality narrat ing itself;film causes an illusion of reality;or film appears natural.² Surely,contemporary theorists are correct in forsaking the extrav- agances of Bazin's ontology of film,the great influence of his theory
notwithstanding.However,contemporary film theory's psychologiz ing of the realist approach,in terms of realist effects,is not very
persuasive.For it requires attributing rather bizarre and frankly
dubious mental states to spectators.Spectators are said to be under
the illusion that the film image is its referent;or we are thought to
believe that the film image is reality narrating itself;or that the film
image is somehow natural.Some of these imputed psychological
effects—for example,"reality narrating itself"—sound downright
incoherent.But all ofthese variations on the realistic effect are suspect
because they attribute to spectators states of belief that would
preclude our characteristic forms of response to,and appreciation of, cinema.For,were we spectators ever to mistake the representations
before us for the referents those images portray,we could not sit by
comfortably,inactively,and appreciatively while buffaloes stampede
toward us,while lovers reveal their deepest longings to each other, and while children are tortured.3
The realist approach to film theory,either as an ontological thesis
or in its more contemporary,psychologized variations,is a dead end. However,the questions that motivated the realist answers may well
be worth asking.That is,what is it that the various realist approaches
in film theory are designed to explain,and is it worth explaining?At
least two candidates seem key here.Realism,especially as a psycho logical effect,is supposed to play a role in explaining the way in
which film disseminates ideology,according to contemporary film
theorists.Second,the attribution of realism is meant to explain the
power of movies,to explain why the moving picture,including
narrative TV,is the dominant art form of the twentieth century. Certainly,“How does cinema promote ideology?"and"What
makes movies powerful?"are good questions.The purpose of this
paper is to attempt to answer the second question,without resorting
to the invocation of realism.4 We shall try to explain what makes
motion pictures our dominant mass art,one that is so widespread, internationally pervasive,and accessible across boundaries of class
and culture.We shall furthermore attempt to explain what makes the
response to movies so intense for so many,especially when compared
to art forms such as opera and theater. The hypothesis of realism was meant to deal with such questions
by suggesting that since films appear to be slices of reality,they are
widely accessible insofar as everyone is familiar with reality.But the
reference to reality here won't give us much help with the intensity of
our response to movies,because in large measure we conceive of the
special intensity of movies exactly in contrast to our more diffuse
responses to quotidian reality.Another way to put this,of course,is
to point out that since our response to reality is so often lackluster,
claiming that a film appears to be a slice of reality promises no
explanation of our extraordinarily intense response to films.So
another explanation,one not reliant upon realism,must be found to
account for the power of movies. To begin an account of the power of movies,some characterization
of the phenomenon in question is relevant.First,the word "movies," as used here,does not refer to film or cinema at large—that is,to a
body of cultural productions that includes,not only commercial, narrative films,but also industrial documentaries,medical training
films,ballistics tests,experimental films,modernist art films,propa- ganda films,and so on.Rather,“movies”refers to popular mass- media films,the products of what might be called Hollywood
International—flms made in what has been dubbed the"classical
style,”whether they be American,Italian,or Chinese,and whether
they be made for the screen or for TV.Movies,in this sense,are a
genre,not the whole,of cinema.It is about this genre's power that
my paper is concerned.Why speak of the power of a genre of cinema
rather than of the power of the medium?Well,the answer to that is
simply that the medium of cinema is not,in and of itself,powerful;it
is not the medium of cinema that has gripped such widespread
audiences so intensely.Instead,it is the adaptation of the medium to
the purposes of Hollywood International.When people speak of the
power of the medium,they are,I believe,talking about the power of
this particular genre or style.For it is the movies,and not modernist
masterpieces or medical instruction films,that have captivated the
twentieth-century popular imagination.It is the power of movies
about which researchers are really curious. To speak of movies rather than film or cinema deliberately eschews
essentialism.Posing the problem in an essentialist idiom-i.e.,what
makes the medium of cinema powerful—would pervert the question. For neither the medium nor every style of film found in it is accessible
to or intensely engaging of mass,popular audiences.Thus,plumbing
the essence of the medium,if there is such a thing,would not provide
the information we seek.Instead of comparing the medium of flm to
other media such as theater or literature,then,this paper will focus
on the genre of movies in order to determine just what features of the
stylistic choices of Hollywood International enable it to evoke a level
of widespread,intensive engagement that is,ex hypothesis,unrivaled
by other media.Indeed,this way of stating the project is not quite
accurate;for it is not the case that the genre of movies is really to be
contrasted with other media,but rather that movies will be con trasted with other genres within other media.We want to know what
features of movies like Red River,Psycho,and Blue Thunder make
them more appealing and more intensely engaging for mass audi- ences than,for example,plays like King Lear and Hurlyburly,ballets
like Giselle,and novels like Middlemarch.My anti-essentialism
amounts to a refusal to answer questions about the power of movies
in terms of the specificity of the medium of cinema.It may seem that
proclaiming this variety of anti-essentialism at this late date is so
much redundant arm-waving.But I'm not sure.The influence of
Christian Metz's recent essay,"The Imaginary Signifier,"which
proceeds methodologically in an essentialist manner,trying to isolate
and analyze a cinema-specific feature of the medium which he
identifies as a special sort of play of presence and absence,testifies to
the persistent appeal ofthe essentialist approach.5
The power of movies comprises two factors:widespread engage- ment and intense engagement.This paper will attempt to explain the
former in terms of those features of movies that make them highly
accessible to broad audiences.It will also try to explain the intensity
ofmovies by examining those features that enable movies to depict a
very high degree of clarity.In a nutshell,its thesis is that the power of
movies resides in their easily graspable clarity for mass audiences. We can begin to understand the general popularity of the movie
genre by considering those features that make it generally accessible
to mass,untutored audiences.A good place to start this investigation
is with the image projected by the single-shot—a close-up of the
hero's face,or a long-view of Castle Dracula.These images are,for
the most part,representational,but,more important,they are
pictorial representations.They refer to their referents by way of
picturing,by displaying or manifesting a delimited range of resem- blances to their referents.By recognizing these similarities,the
spectator comes to know what the picture depicts,whether a man,a
horse,a house,and so on. Given that the typical movie image is a pictorial representation, what has this to do with accessibility?Well,a picture is a very special
sort of symbol.Psychological evidence strongly supports the conten tion that we learn to recognize what a picture stands for as soon as we
have become able to recognize the objects,or kinds of objects,that
serve as the models for that picture.Picture recognition is not a skill
acquired over and above object recognition.Whatever features or
cues we come to employ in object recognition,we also mobilize to
recognize what pictures depict.A child raised without pictorial
representations will,after being shown a couple ofpictures,be able to
identify the referent of any picture of an object with which he or she
is familiar.The rapid development of this picture-recognition capac ity contrasts strongly with the acquisition of a symbol system such as
language.Upon mastering a couple of words,the child is nowhere
near mastering the entire language.Similarly,when an adult is
exposed to one or two representational pictures in an alien pictorial
idiom,say a Westerner confronting a Japanese image in the floating- point-of-view style,he will be able to identify the referent of any
picture in that format after studying one or two representations of
that sort for a few moments.But no Westerner,upon learning one or
two linguistic symbols of the Japanese language,could go on to
identify the reference of all,or even merely a few more,Japanese
words.Moreover,historically the Japanese were eminently able to
catch on to and replicate the Western system of perspectival picturing
by examining a selection of book illustrations;but they could never
have acquired any European language by learning the meanings of
just a few words or phrases.?
Pictorial representations thus differ radically from linguistic repre- sentations.The speed with which the former is mastered suggests that
it does not require special learning,above the realization,perhaps, that flat surfaces are being used to stand for three-dimensional
objects.Rather,the capacity to recognize what a picture depicts
emerges in tandem with the capacity to recognize the kind of object
that serves as the model of the picture.The reciprocal relation
between picture recognition and object recognition,of course,ex- plains how it is possible for us,having acquired detailed visual
information from pictures,to recognize objects and places we have
never encountered in real life.And,of course,the fact that pictorial
recognition does not require any special learning process would also
explain how movies,whose basic constituent symbols are pictures, are immediately accessible to untutored audiences in every corner of
the world.These audiences do not need any special training to deal
with the basic images in movies,for the capacity to recognize what
these images are about has evolved part and parcel with the viewer's
capacity to recognize objects and events. The technology of film could be adapted in such a way that the
basic images of a film genre or flm style were not pictorial represen tations.One could imagine a motion picture industry of changing
abstract forms,after the fashion of Hans Richter's Rhythmus zI,or
one of spectacles of color,such as Stan Brakhage's Text of Light.But
that was not the road taken by the movies.Movies became a
worldwide phenomenon—and a lucrative industry-precisely be- cause in their exploitation of pictorial recognition—as opposed to
symbol systems that require mastery of processes such as reading, decoding,or deciphering in order to be understood—they rely on a
biological capability that is nurtured in humans as they learn to
identify the objects and events in their environment. The basic images in movies are not simply pictorial representa tions;they are,standardly,moving pictorial representations.But just
as an audience need not go through a process of learning to “read” pictures,neither is its perception of movie“movement”learned. Rather,it is a function of the way stroboscopic or beta phenomena
affect the brain's organization of congruous input presented in
specifiable sequences to different points on the retina.Of course, following a movie involves much more than the capacity to recognize
what its moving images represent.But we should not overlook the
crucial role that the relative ease of comprehending the basic symbols
of movies plays in making movies readily accessible. The remarks thus far are apt to displease the majority of cinema
researchers.For the contention that pictures(and,by extension, moving pictures)work by looking like their referents in those
pertinent respects to which our perceptual system is keyed,goes
against the contemporary received wisdom that pictures,like any
other symbol,are matters of codes and conventions.Undoubtedly, some reader will recall an anthropology class in which he was told
that certain non-Western peoples were unable to understand pictures
shown to them by missionaries and other field workers.However, this evidence has never been entirely decisive.Complaints about the
fidelity of the photographs involved have been raised,along with the
more serious objection that what the subjects failed to understand, and then only initially,was the practice of using flat surfaces to
portray three-dimensional objects.8 Once they got the hang of that,
they had no trouble in recognizing what hitherto unseen pictures
referred to—assuming they were familiar with the kinds of objects
displayed in the pictures.9 Also,on the non-conventionalist side ofthe
scale,we must weigh the psychological evidence of the child's
acquisition of pictorial recognition,the easy cross-cultural dissemina tion of pictorial practices,and the zoological evidence that certain
animals have the capacity for pictorial recognition,10 against exotic
anecdotes that are meant to demonstrate that the practices of
picturing are cultural conventions that must be learned in the fashion
of a language.We can consider our own cases.We all recall our own
language acquisition,and we know how to go about helping young- sters to learn to speak and to read.But who remembers undergoing
a similar process in regard to pictures,and what techniques would we
employ to teach a youngster pictorial literacy?Yes,we may show a
child a few pictures and say the name of the object portrayed.But
very shortly the child just sees what the picture is of;the child doesn't “read”the picture or decode it or go through some process of
inference.And from a meager set of samples,the child can proceed to
identify the subjects of a plethora of pictures,because there is a
continuum between apprehending pictorial representations and per- ceiving the world that does not depend upon learning anything like
the conventional,arbitrary correlations of a vocabulary,or the
combinatory principles of a grammar. There is undoubtedly a temptation to think that picture recog- nition involves some process of decoding or inference because of
the contemporary influence of the computational metaphor of the
mind.We think that computers supply us with powerful insight into
how the mind works.And if we were to build a computer to sim- ulate pictorial recognition,it would require a complex information- processing system.But it does not follow that if computers employ
complex information-processing systems in pictorial recognition, then humans must likewise possess such systems.It may rather be
that our neurophysiology is so constructed that when stimulated by
certain pictorial arrays,we see what the picture is of.John Searle
notes that balance is controlled by the fuids in our inner ear.Were a
robot to be built,balance would probably be governed by some
complex computational program.But,for us,balance is a matter
governed by our fleshy hardware.11 A similar case might be made
that biology—rather than information processing-may have a great
deal to tell us about the workings of object recognition and picture
recognition.And to the extent that pictorial representation is a matter
of the way in which humans are made,a practice rooted in pictorial
representation—such as the movies—will be widely and easily acces- sible to all humans made that way. Many contemporary semiotically inclined film theorists resist
approaching pictorial representation in the movies in the preceding
fashion.Their resistance rests on a confusion,or rather a conflation, on their part of the ideas of code,convention,and culture;terms that
in film studies are treated as equivalent.If something is coded or
conventional,then it is regarded as a cultural production.This seems
fair enough.But it is more problematic to presume,as film research- ers do,the opposite;that if something is a cultural product,then it is
an example of coded or conventional phenomena.Thus,if pictorial
representations,including moving,pictorial representations,are cul tural productions,which they certainly are,then they must be
conventional.The diffculty here lies in the assumption that every thing that is cultural is necessarily conventional. Consider plows.They are cultural productions.They were pro- duced by certain agricultural civilizations that had culturally specific
needs not shared,for example,by hunter-gatherers.Is the design of a
plow a matter of convention?Recall,here,that for semiotic flm
theorists,arbitrariness is a key defining feature of a convention.That
is,a group creates a convention—like driving on the right side ofthe
road—when there are a number of alternative ways of dealing with
the situation and when the choice between these alternatives is
arbitrary,a matter of fiat.But the adoption of the design of the plow
could not have been reached by fiat.The plow had a purpose—
digging furrows-and its effectiveness had to be accommodated to
the structure of nature.It would have to be heavy enough and sharp
enough to cut into the earth,and it had to be adapted to the capacities
of its human users—it had to be steerable and pullable by creatures
like us with two arms and limited strength.A device such as a plow
had to be discovered;it could not be brought into existence by
consensus.We could not have elected pogo-sticks to do the work of
plows.The plow was a cultural invention,not a cultural convention. It was adopted because it worked,because it met a cultural need by
accommodating features of nature and biology.
The point of introducing the concept of a cultural invention here is, of course,to block the facile identification of the cultural and the
conventional.Applied to the sort of pictorial representations found in
movies,this concept suggests that pictorial representations may be
cultural inventions,inventions that,given the way people are built, cause spectators who are untrained in any system of conventions to
recognize what pictures stand for.The structure of such images is not
determinable by a mere decision.Given the constraints of the human
perceptual apparatus,we cannot decree that anything looks like
anything else,though we may decree that anything can stand for
anything else.It seems cogent to suppose that this limitation is in
large measure attributable to human biology.And insofar as movies
are constituted of a mode of representation connected to biological
features of the human organism,they will be generally more acces- sible than genres in other media,such as the novel,that presuppose
the mastery of learned conventions such as specific natural languages. Also,if the recognition of movie images is more analogous to a reflex
than it is to a process like reading,then following a movie may turn
out to be less taxing,less a matter of active effort,than reading. Perhaps this can be confirmed by recalling how much easier it is to
follow a movie when one is fatigued than it is to read a novel. The claim has so far been made that a crucial element in the power
of movies is the fact that movies usually rely,in terms of their basic
imagery,on pictorial representations that allow masses of untutored
spectators easy access to the fundamental symbols in the system,due
to the way humans are constructed.But is this not just a reversion to
the kind of realist explanation we began by dismissing?Not at all. The Bazinian claims that the spectator somehow takes the flm image
to be identical with its referent,while contemporary film theorists
hold that the typical film image imparts the illusion of reality, transparency,or naturalness.This paper,though,has not invoked
any of these realist,psychological effects,nor anything like them.It
has instead claimed that the untutored spectator recognizes what the
film image represents without reference to a code;it has not claimed
that the spectator takes the pictorial representation to be,in any
sense,its referent.Man's perceptual capacities evolve in such a way
that his capacity for pictorial recognition comes,almost naturally, with his capacity for object recognition,and part of that capacity is
the ability to differentiate pictures from their referents.Thus,we are
not talking about a realist,psychological effect—the taking of a
representation for its referent—but only about the capacity of movies
to exploit generic,recognitional abilities.Another way to see the
difference between this approach and that of the realists is to note
how often their accounts of the power of movies emphasize the
importance of the fact that movies are photographic,whereas in the
account offered here the important technology for explaining the
accessibility of movies is the non-cinema-specific technology of
pictorial representation. If up to this point anything can be said to have been demonstrated, then,admittedly,it must also be conceded that we are a good
distance away from a full account of the power of movies.We have
explained why movies are more accessible than genres like novels. But what features of movies account for their presumably superior
accessibility and intensity in comparison with media and genres like
drama,ballet,and opera,in which recognition of what the represen tations refer to is,like movies,typically not mediated by learned
processes of decoding,reading,or inference?What standard features
of movies differentiate them from the standard features of the
presentation of plays,for example,in a way that make typical movies
more accessible than typical theatrical performances?Our hypothesis
is that due to certain devices developed early in the evolution of
movies,the typical movie is,all things being equal,easier to follow
than the typical play,i.e.,theatrical performances as have so far been
commonly encountered.This caveat is added because there is no
reason to believe that theatrical devices that would be functionally
equivalent to the movie devices about to be discussed could not be
invented,thus changing the relative accessibility of typical movies
and typical plays.Our anti-essentialist bias,however,demands that
we not compare the eternal essence of the film medium with its
putative theatrical counterpart,but rather the state of the art of
movies with the state of the art of theatrical production. Movies are said to be more accessible than plays.What does this
mean?We have asserted that movies are easier to follow than plays. What is it that is distinctive about the way in which spectators follow
movies?With the typical movie,given certain of its characteristic
devices,notably variable framing,the movie viewer is generally in a
position where he or she is attending to exactly what is significant in
the action-array or spectacle on screen.Another way of getting at this
point is to say that the filmmaker in the movie genre has far more
potential control over the spectator's attention than does the theat rical director.The consequence of this is that the movie spectator is
always looking where he or she should be looking,always attending
to the right details and thereby comprehending,nearly effortlessly, the ongoing action precisely in the way it is meant to be understood. Due to various devices,such as variable framing,movies are easier to
follow and,therefore,more accssible than theatrical productions
because movies are more perspicuous cognitively.The element of
cognitive clarity afforded by movies may well account,too,for the
widespread intensity of engagement that movies elicit. Of course,movies and standard theatrical productions share many
of the same devices for directing the audience's attention.Both in the
medium-long shot and on the proscenium stage,the audience's
attention can be guided by:the central positioning of an important
character;movement in stasis;stasis in movement;characters' eyelines;light colors on dark fields;dark colors on light fields;sound, notably dialogue;spotighting and variable illumination of the array;
placement of important objects or characters along arresting diago- nals;economy of set details;makeup and costume;commentary;
gestures;and so on.But movies appear to have further devices and
perhaps more effective devices for directing attention than does
theater as it is presently practiced.The variability of focus in flm,for
example,is a more reliable means of making sure that the audience is
looking where the spectator "ought"to be looking than is theatrical
lighting.Even more important is the use in movies of variable
framing.Through cutting and camera movement,the filmmaker can
rest assured that the spectator is perceiving exactly what she should
be perceiving at the precise moment she should be perceiving it. When the camera comes in for a close-up,for example,there is no
possibility_that the spectator can be distracted by some detail
stage-left.Everything extraneous to the story at that point is deleted. Nor does the spectator have to find the signifcant detail;it is
delivered to her.The viewer also gets as close or as far-off a view of
the signifcant objects of the story—be they heroines,butcher knives, mobs,fortresses,or planets—as is useful for her to have a concrete
sense of what is going on.Whereas in a theater the eye constantly
tracks the action—often at a felt distance,often amidst a vaulting
space—in movies much of that work is done by shifing camera
positions,which at the same time also assures that the average viewer
has not gotten lost in the space but is looking precisely at that which
she is supposed to see.Movies are therefore easier to follow than
typical stage productions,because the shifting camera positions make
it practically impossible for the movie viewer not to be attending
where she is meant to attend. Variable framing in film is achieved by moving the camera closer
or farther away from the objects being filmed.Cutting and camera
movement are the two major processes for shifing framing:in the
former,the actual process of the camera's change of position is not
included in the shot;we jump from medium-range views,to close
views,to far-off views with the traversal of the space between
excised;in camera movement,as the name suggests,the passage of
the camera from a long view to a close view is recorded within the
shot.Reframing can also be achieved optically through devices such
as zooming-in and changing lenses.These mechanical means for
changing the framing of an on-screen object or event give rise to three
formal devices for directing the movie audience's attention:indexing, bracketing,and scaling.Indexing occurs when a camera is moved
toward an object.The motion toward the object functions osten- sively,like the gesture of pointing.It indicates that the viewer ought
to be looking in the direction the camera is moving,if the camera's
movement is being recorded,or in the direction toward which the
camera is aimed or pointing,if we have been presented with the shot
via a cut. When a camera is moved towards an array,it screens out every thing beyond the frame.To move a camera toward an object either
by cutting or camera movement generally has the force of indicating
that what is important at this moment is what is on screen,what is in
the perimeter of the frame.That which is not inside the frame has
been bracketed,excluded.It should not,and in fact it literally cannot, at the moment it is bracketed,be attended to.At the same time, bracketing has an inclusionary dimension,indicating that what is
inside the frame or bracket is important.A standard camera position
will mobilize both the exclusionary and inclusionary dimensions of
the bracket to control attention,though the relative degree may vary
as to whether a given bracketing is more important for what it
excludes,rather than what it includes,and vice-versa.
There is also a standard deviation from this use of bracketing. Often the important element of a scene is placed outside the frame so
that it is not visible onscreen,e.g.,the child-killer in the early part of
Fritz Lang's M.Such scenes derive a great deal of their expressive
powerjust because they subvert the standard function of bracketing. As the camera is moved forward,it not only indexes and places
brackets around the objects in front of it;it also changes their scale. Whether by cutting or camera movement,as the camera nears the
gun on the table,the gun simultaneously appears larger and occupies
more screen space.When the camera is pulled away from the table, the gun occupies less screen space.This capacity to change the scale
of objects through camera positioning-a process called "scaling"- can be exploited for expressive or magical effects.Scaling is also a
lever for directing attention.Enlarging the screen size of an object
generally has the force of stating that this object,or gestalt of objects, is the important item to attend to at this moment in the movie. Scaling,bracketing,and indexing are three different ways of
directing the movie spectator's attention through camera positioning. In general,a standard camera positioning,whether executed by
cutting or camera movement,will employ all three of these means. But one can easily think of scenes in which the bracket is reoriented, but the scaling stays effectively the same,for example,a lateral pan as
a character walks toward the edge of the frame.Likewise,a camera
movement might be important for what it indexes rather than for
whatever changes occur in the bracketing or the scaling:there are
moving shots in the early Italian film Cabiria,for example,where the
camera nudges a few feet forward in a spectacle scene in order to
point the viewer's eye in a certain direction,though neither the
bracket nor the scale of the objects in the scene are changed
appreciably.Both the swamp scene and the trolley-car scene in
Sunrise are artistically important for the way in which they call
attention to the bracket,rather than for their scaling or indexing. However,bracketing,scaling,and indexing can be employed in
tandem,and when they are,they afford very powerful means by
which the movie-maker controls the audience's attention.We sud- denly see a dose-up of a gun,indexed,scaled,and bracketed as the
important object in the scene,and then the bracket is changed-we
see a medium shot in which the gun is being pointed at the heroine by
the villain,telling us that now the important thing about the gun is its
role within this newly framed context or gestalt.The constant
reframing of the action that is endemic to movies enables the
spectator to follow the action perfectly,and,so to say,automatically. Adaptations of stage technology,of course,could probably estab lish theatrical means that would be functionally equivalent to the
scaling,bracketing,and indexing functions of movies.Magnifying
mirrors might be used to enlarge stage details at appropriate mo- ments;the leg curtains could be motorized to constantly reframe the
action;and indexing might be approximated by use of revolving
stages that rotate the important characters and actions toward the
audience.If these devices were not too distracting in and of them- selves,they might provide the theater director with attentional levers
that are functionally equivalent to scaling,bracketing,and indexing. However,these devices are not customary in theater as we presently
know it,and our project here is to contrast movies as they are with
theater as it currently is. Of course,films can be made without variable framing;but movies
rely on variable framing to automatize the spectator's attention.Also, variable framing is not unique to movies;other film genres employ it. Yet it is key to why movies are accessible;as we have noted,it
contributes to the intensity of engagement movies promote.Through
variable framing,the director assures that the spectator is attending
where and when she should.The action and its details unfold in such
a way that every element that is relevant is displayed at a distance that
makes it eminently recognizable and,in a sequence that is intelligible. Ideally,variable framing allows us to see just what we need to see at
changing distances and at cadences that render the action perspicu- ous.The action is analytically broken down into its most salient
elements,distilled,that is,in a way that makes it extremely legible. This kind of clarity,which is bequeathed to the audience automati- cally by variable framing,contrasts strongly with the depiction of
action in theatrical representations.There,the depiction is not
analytic but a matter of physical enactment,generally occurring in
something approximating real time,and presented at a fixed distance
to each viewer.Of course,theatrical action is abstracted,simplified, for the sake of legibility,often employing emblematic gestures.It is
clearer,that is,than the actions we encounter in everyday life.But
theatrical action is not as clear and analytically distinct as movie
action as portrayed by variable framing.Movie action,given the way
it can be organized through camera positioning,is also far more
intelligible than the unstaged events we witness in everyday life.This
is an important feature that helps account for the way in which
movies grip us. Our experience of actions and events in movies differs radically
from our normal experiences;movie actions and events are so
organized,so automatically intelligible,and so clear.The arresting
thing about movies,contra realist theories,is not that they create the
illusion of reality,but that they reorganize and construct,through
variable framing,actions and events with an economy,legibility,and
coherence that are not only automatically available,but which
surpass,in terms of their immediately perceptible basic structure, naturally encountered actions and events.Movie actions evince
visible order and identity to a degree not found in everyday experi- ence.This quality of uncluttered clarity gratifies the mind's quest for
order,thereby intensifying our engagement with the screen. So far,our speculations about the sources of the power of movies
have been restricted to what would have classically been considered
the medium's“cinematic features”:pictorial representation and
variable framing.This,of course,does not reflect a belief that these
elements are uniquely cinematic,but only that they are features that
help account for movies'power,the capacity to engender what
appears to be an unprecedentedly widespread and intense level of
engagement.There is another core defining features of what we are
calling movies that needs to be treated:this is that they are fictional
narratives.The question naturally arises to what degree this fact
about movies can help explain their power. The fact that movies tend to be narrative,concerned primarily with
depictions of human actions,immediately suggests one of the reasons
they are accessible.For narrative is,in all probability,our most
pervasive and familiar means of explaining human action.If you ask
me why George is watering the tulips,I may answer that George
intends to have,or wants,a beautiful garden,and that he believes
that he can't have a beautiful garden unless he waters the tulips.So I
say he undertakes to water the tulips.You might ask me how he
formed the desire to have a beautiful garden.I may refer to either his
belief that this is a means to being a good citizen or his guilt about
never caring for his father's garden,or both if his action is
overdetermined.If you ask,where did he get the notion that the
garden would not be beautiful unless he watered it,I say he read it in
a book called Beautiful Gardens on May 17,1953.Now if we tried
to sum up this somewhat banal explanation of George's action,a
narrative would probably be the likeliest,though not the only,means
of organizing our information:George,racked with guilt feelings
about his father's tulips and convinced that a beautiful garden is a
means to the coveted ideal of good citizenship,decided to have a
beautiful garden;and when he read,on May I7,1953,that such
gardens could not be had without watering the tulips,he went out
and watered the tulips (on May 18).We might add that he continued
to do so happily ever after.Insofar as this sort of narrative is one of
the most common forms of human explanation,and insofar as much
movie narration belongs to this category,movies will be familiar and
accessible.Moreover,the explanatory quality of such narration will
also contribute to the clarity of movies. Of course,the logical relations that subtend this sort of narrative, at crucial points,remind one,and are parasitic upon,those of
practical inference.If I am George,for example,I reason thusly:I
want a beautiful garden;I do not believe I can secure a beautiful
garden unless I water the tulips;therefore,I proceed to water the
tulips.What makes narratives of the sort that I told above explana tory is that they,at nodal moments,reflect processes of practical
reasoning.Practical reasoning is part of everyone's life.And the
actions of others are intelligible to me when I can see them as
consequences of the sort of practical reasoning I employ.Insofar as
movie narratives depict the human actions of characters in forms that
are reflective of the logic of practical inference,the movies will be
widely accessible,since practical inference is a generic form of human
decision-making. Undoubtedly,this discussion of narrative may be too broad and
too abstract to be of much use to the film analyst.In all probability
nothing of great interest would be gained in film studies by showing
that a series of scenes reflected a series of practical inferences on the
part of characters.Rather,the film scholar will be interested in an
analysis of the characteristic forms of plotting found in movies;she
will want these described more specifically than they were in the
preceding discussion.And she will want to know what it is about
these forms,if anything,that contributes to the power of movies.
In a recent paper on film suspense,l²I attempted to identify what
I think is the most basic form of movie plotting,and I would like to
take advantage of those speculations now.My position owes a great
deal to the Soviet flmmaker and theoretician V.I.Pudovkin.13
Pudovkin,like his teacher,L.Kuleshov,studied American movies, contrasting them with Russian films in order to discern what made
the American films of the twenties more effective on popular audi- ences than were comparable Russian films.Pudovkin and Kuleshov
undertook this investigation,of course,in order to calculate the best
means for creating a new Soviet cinema for the masses.The theories
of filmmaking they produced were meant to instruct other film- makers in technique and praxis.As is well known,Pudovkin and
Kuleshov tended to become very prescriptive in these matters,a
tendency for which they have been duly chastised ever since.But
whatever their dogmatism,we should not overlook the fact that
beneath their debatable prescriptions about the way films should be
made,they often had valuable insights into the way in which popular
films,especially Hollywood movies,were actually constructed.What
Pudovkin has to say about movie narration is a case in point. A story film will portray a sequence of scenes or events,some
appearing earlier,some later.A practical problem that confronts the
filmmaker is the way in which these scenes are to be connected,i.e., what sort of relation the earlier scenes should bear to the later ones. Pudovkin recommends—as a primary,though not exclusive,solu tion—that earlier scenes be related to later scenes as questions are to
answers.If a giant shark appears offshore,unbeknownst to the local
authorities,and begins to ravage lonely swimmers,this scene or series
of scenes (or this event or series of events)raises the question of
whether the shark will ever be detected.This question is likely to be
answered in some later scene when someone figures out why all those
swimmers are missing.At that point,when it is learnt that the shark
is very,very powerful and nasty to boot,the question arises about
whether it can be destroyed or driven away.The ensuing events in the
film serve to answer that question.Or,if some atomic bombs are
skyjacked in the opening scenes,this generates questions about who
stole them and for what purposes.Once the generally nefarious
purposes of the hijacking are established,the question arises concern ing whether these treacherous intents can be thwarted.Or,for a
slightly more complicated scenario,shortly after a jumbo jet takes off,
we learn that the entire crew hasjust died from food poisoning while
also learning that the couple in first class is estranged.These scenes
raise the questions of whether the plane will crash and whether the
couple in first class will be reconciled by their common ordeal. Maybe we also ask whether the alcoholic priest in coach will find
God again.It is the function of the later scenes in the film to answer
these questions, Of course,the narrative organization of Hollywood films is far
more complex than these examples suggest,and I have tried to
develop this subject with more precision elsewhere.14 For present
purposes,let us say that,as is suggested by the writings of Pudovkin, the core narrative structures of Hollywood-type films-the movies
discussed in this paper—involve generating questions that ensuing
scenes answer.Not all narrative films employ this approach.Often, modernist films generate questions—e.g.,did I meet her at
Marienbad before?—without supplying any answers.Or,I might
chronicle my day at the beach:first I had a hot dog,then I put on
suntan lotion,then I swam,then I went home.Surely we can conceive
of a home movie like this,where none of the early scenes raised any
questions,and where none of the later ones supplied any answers. Thus,to narrate by generating questions internal to the film that
subsequent scenes answer is a distinctive form of narration.Admit tedly,this is not a form unique to films or movies,for it is also
exploited in mystery novels,adventure stories,Harlequin romances, Marvel comics,and so on.Nevertheless,it is the most characteristic
narrative approach in movies. How can this be proven?The best suggestion one can make here is
to embrace the question/answer model of movie narration—what I
call the erotetic model of narrative—and then turn on your TV,watch
old movies and new ones,TV adventure series and romances, domestic films and foreign popular films.Ask yourself why the later
scenes in the films make sense in the context ofthe earlier scenes.My
prediction is that you will be surprised by the extent to which later
scenes are answering questions raised earlier,or are at least providing
information that will contribute to such answers.In adopting the
hypothesis that the narrative structure of a randomly selected movie
is fundamentally a system of internally generated questions that the
movie goes on to answer,you will find that you have hold of a
relationship that enables you to explain what makes certain scenes
especially key:they either raise questions or answer them,or perform
related functions including sustaining questions already raised,or
incompletely answering a previous question,or answering one ques tion but then introducing a new one. Apart from the confirmation of the hypothesis afforded by this
confrontation with empirical data,further support for the
question/answer model might be gained by using it,not to analyze, but to develop movie scenarios.For when certain complexities and
qualifications are added to the model of the erotetic narrative,it is a
very serviceable guide for producing stories that strike one as
typically“movieish,”especially in their economy.Partial confirma tion of the question/answer model is its capacity to direct the
simulation of movie scenarios. If the model of the erotetic narrative captures the characteristic
narrative form of movies,then perhaps we can note certain features
of this mode of narration which will shed light on the power of
movies.A movie scene or a series of depicted events make certain
questions salient.An orphan wanders the street,importuning adults
needfully.Will the orphan find a surrogate parent?This could be
answered in the next scene,or it could take the entire film to answer. However,by characterizing the function of this scene as that of
saliently posing a question,we have put ourselves in a position to
account for one of the most notable features of audience responses to
linear narrative movies,that is,expectation.Given the erotetic model, we can say what it is that audiences expect:they expect answers to
the questions that earlier events have made salient—will the shark be
stopped;will the jumbo jet crash?If it is a general feature of our
cognitive make-up that,all things being equal,we not only want but
expect answers to questions that have assertively been put before us, this helps explain our widespread,intense engagement with movies. Even if the question is as insignificant to us as whether the suburban
adolescent in Risky Business will be found out by his parents,our
curiosity keeps us riveted to the screen until it is satisfied. Though space does not allow for a full elaboration of the mat ter,important distinctions can be made among the different types
of questions that animate the erotetic movie narrative.One such
distinction can be drawn between micro-questions and
macro-questions.A scene or an event may raise a question that is
immediately answered in the succceding scene or by the succeeding
event,or by a scene or event temporally proximate to the questioning
scene.For example,some burglars trigger an alarm.This raises the
question of whether the authorities will hear it.Next,there is a scene
of two policemen reading magazines in their squad car;they look up
and switch on their siren,raising the question of whether they will
arrive at the scene of the crime on time,and so on.Such localized
networks of questions and answers are“micro”in nature.They
connect two individual scenes or a limited series of scenes and
sequences.But movies are also generally animated by
macro-questions,ones for which we await answers throughout most
of the film,and which may be thought of as organizing the bulk of
significant action in the movie—indeed,the micro-questions are
generally hierarchically subordinate to the macro-questions.For an
example of a macro-question,consider Wargames;at a certain point
most of the action is devoted to answering the question of whether
nuclear destruction can be averted.Of course,movies often have
more than one macro-question.Into the Night asks both whether the
romantic leads can escape the Middle Eastern villains and whether
this couple will become lovers.Both macro-questions are answered
by means of roughly the same sequences of action,and the micro- questions and answers that structure those sequences tend,finally,to
dovetail with the answers to these presiding macro-questions.What
is called“closure”in movies can be explained as that moment when
all the saliently posed and sustained questions that the movie has
raised have been answered. A successful erotetic narrative tells you,literally,everything you
want to know about the action being depicted,i.e.,it answers every
question,or virtually every question,that it has chosen to pose
saliently.(I say “virtually”in order to accommodate endings such as
that in the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers,where the
audience is left with one last pregnant question.)But even counte- nancing these cases,an erotetic movie narrative has an extraordinary
degree of neatness and intellectually appealing compactness.It an- swers all the questions that it assertively presents to the audience,and
the largest portion of its actions is organized by a small number of
macro-questions,with little remainder.The flow of action ap- proaches an ideal of uncluttered clarity.This clarity contrasts vividly
with the quality of the fragments of actions and events we typically
observe in everyday life.Unlike those in real life,the actions observed
in movies have a level of intelligibility,due to the role they play in the
erotetic narrative's system of questions and answers.Because of the
question/answer structure,the audience is left with the impression
that it has learned everything important to know concerning the
action depicted.How is this achieved?By assertively introducing a
selected set of pressing questions and then answering them—by
controlling expectation by the manner in which questions are posed. This imbues the film with an aura of clarity while also affording an
intense satisfaction concerning our cognitive expectations and our
propensity for intelligibility. The clarity imparted by the erotetic narrative in movies is,of
course,reinforced by other clarity-producing methods,such as di recting audience attention through the single shot or variable fram ing.These devices are the filmmaker's means of visual narration. They enable him to raise questions visually:the question“Will Jones
be shot?”can be“asked”by focusing on a close-up of a gun.At the
same time,the visual depiction of an action can either sustain or
answer a question.“Will Eli Wallach die by hanging?”can be
sustained by showing him teetering on a chair with a noose around
his neck,or answered by showing us Clint Eastwood severing the
rope in an act of super-human markmanship.Of course,many of the
pressing questions that drive movies forward are not primarily set
forth visually but are stated explicitly in the dialogue,or are already
implied in the scripting of the action.Nevertheless,the devices of
visual narration,if not the original source of the questions,help make
those questions salient. The visual devices of movies were earlier described in terms of the
type of clarity they afforded the audience,of how they enable the
audience to see all that it is relevant for them to see at the appropriate
distance and in the appropriate sequence.At the same time,another
sort of clarity has been attributed to the erotetic narrative as a
primary ground of the power of movies.How do these two
“clarities”relate to each other?Well,generally in movies,devices
such as scaling,bracketing,and indexing will be employed so that the
first item or the first gestalt of items that the audience is led to attend
to in a given shot is the item or gestalt that is most relevant to the
progress of the narrative—to the posing,sustaining,or answering of
those questions the movie elects to answer.The importance of
variable framing for movies is the potentialit affords for assuring that
the audience attends to everything that is relevant,and that it does so
automatically,so to speak.“Relevance”is here determined by the
narrative,or,more specifically the questions and answers that drive
the narrative,which in turn are saliently posed and answered in
important ways by means of variable framing. In order for this account to be adequate,certain qualifications need
to be acknowledged.While generally processes such as variable
framing are coordinated with the narrative for the purpose of
emphasizing the first item,or gestalt of items,seen by the audience, there are standard deviations to this principle.These deviations are
often employed in thrillers for shock effect:the important subject, say,the killer,is hidden in the shot in such a way that the audience
only comes to see him belatedly(but unavoidably).In terms of our
account,these deviations are not destructive counterexamples,be- cause they still illustrate how the flow of narration is kept under strict
control and the audience in rapt attention. Standard movies also often contain much material that is digressive
from the point of view of the erotetic narrative,for example,a
melodic interlude from the heroine by the campfire in a Western. While this paper cannot fully develop a theory of such digressions,it
will suggest that the most important digressions typically found in
movies are a function of the sub-genres the movies in question belong
to(one could go on to explain those digressions by analyzing the
sub-genres they most frequently appear in and,perhaps,proceed to
analyze the power of those sub-genres). We began by addressing the issue of the power of movies,which
was understood as a question concerning the ways in which movies
have engaged the widespread,intense response of untutored audi- ences throughout the century.We have dealt with the issue of the
widespread response to movies by pointing to those features of
movies that make them particularly accessible.We have also dealt
with our intense engagement with movies in terms ofthe impression
of coherence they impart,i.e.,their easily grasped,indeed,their
almost unavoidable,clarity.The accessibility of movies is at least
attributable to their use of pictorial representation,variable framing, and narrative,the latter being the most pervasive form of explaining
human actions.Their clarity is at least a function of variable framing
in coordination with the erotetic narrative,especially where erotetic
narration and variable framing are coordinated by the principle that
the first item or gestalt of items the audience apprehends be that
which,out of alternative framings,is most important to the narra tion.In short,this thesis holds that the power of movies—their
capacity to evoke unrivaled widespread and intense response—is, first and foremost,at least a result of their deployment of pictorial
representation,variable framing,and the erotetic narrative. It will undoubtedly be noted that in this attempt to account for the
power of movies,we have restricted our purview to features in
movies which address the cognitive faculties of the audience.This is
absolutely central to the argument.For only by focusing on cognitive
capacities,especially ones as deeply embedded as pictorial represen tation,practical reason,and the drive to get answers to our questions, will we be in the best position to find the features of movies that
account for their phenomenally widespread effectiveness;since cog- nitive capacities,at the level discussed,seem the most plausible
candidate for what mass-movie audiences have in common.That is, the question of the power of movies involves explaining how peoples
of different cultures,societies,nations,races,creed,educational
backgrounds,age groups,and sexes can find movies easily accessible
and gripping.Thus,the power of movies must be connected to some
fairly generic features of human organisms to account for their power
across class,cultural,and educational boundaries.The structures of
perception and cognition are primary examples of fairly generic
features of humans.Consequently,it seems that if we can suggest the
ways in which movies are designed to engage and excite cognitive and
perceptual structures,we will have our best initial approximation of
their generic power. Some qualifications,of course,are in order.First,we are not
claiming that people do not respond intensely to forms other than
movies;indeed,some people respond more intensely to other art
forms than they do to movies.There are opera buffs and bal letomanes,after all.But this is compatible with the claim we are
examining,that there is something special about the widespread and
intense,though not necessarily universal,response that movies have
been observed to command. Next,we are not denying that there may be levers beyond those we
have discussed that also figure in the account of the power of movies. Marketing structures,including adverising,are important elements,
as well as factors such as the transportability and reproducability of
movies.Research in these areas should not be abandoned.However, considerations along these lines do not obviate the present sort of
speculation,since there must still be something about the product,so
marketed,that sustains interest. Pictorial representations,variable framing,erotetic narration,and
the interrelation of these elements in the ways proposed will,at the
very least,be constituents of any account of the power of movies. This paper does not pretend to have offered a complete account of
why movies are powerful-its modesty is signaled by the hedge"at
the very least.”Perhaps movies employ other clarifying features,such
as music,that require analysis.Furthermore,apart from the question
of why movies are powerful,we may wish to pursue different,but
related,questions about why certain movies or groups of movies are
powerful for certain groups of people;how do movies,or at least
certain varieties of movies,engage particular classes,nations,gen- ders,and so on.Theoretical interest in these questions would
undoubtedly lead to a focus on elements of structure and content that
have not been addressed here,since we have been concerned with the
generic power of movies,not the power of movies for specific times, locales,sexes,and interest groups.However,nothing we have said
suggests an objection in principle to these more specific questions, which questions,of course,will,in all probability,lead to speculation
about aspects of audiences over and above their cognitive faculties. Social conditioning and affective psychology,appropriately historic ized,must be introduced to explain the power of given movies for
target groups.Sociology,anthropology,and certain forms of psycho- analysis are likely to be useful in such investigations.We can
therefore continue to examine the power of movies by asking about
the power of certain movies for historically specific audiences. However,if we wish to explain the power of movies for the world
community,then pictorial representation,variable framing,and the
erotetic narrative will be key elements in our account because of the
ways in which they address common cognitive and perceptual
capacities.
