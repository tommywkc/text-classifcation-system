 
American beauty: trade flows and export costs of US movies

Abstract This paper estimates a hedonic model of revenues for 1431 American 
movies in 45 non-American countries over the period 2002–2013. Such an extensive 
analysis is proven to be useful to estimate the efect of indicators of geographical 
and cultural distance on total revenue and the number of American flms exported to 
non-American countries once the model specifcation also controls for relevant flm 
features. It is found that indicators of cultural and geographical distance, in addition 
to the Human Development Index, have a signifcant efect on both the number of 
American flms shown and the revenue obtained. Estimation results have been also 
used to appraise the importance of flm features in diferent groups of countries from 
the perspective of their degree of development and distance from the USA.

1 Introduction
The American motion picture industry is of high economic interest for researchers 
in international trade and decision makers within the industry. For the frst group, 
the industry ofers relevant information on trade patterns along diferent nations for 
an American service product. This facilitates analysis of how international trade var ies in terms of country-level variables, trade restrictions, and diferent flm features. 
Moreover, this investigation is of high cultural importance as it appraises how coun tries with diferent cultures and traditions pay attention to American products.
The analysis of American flms is also relevant from a decision management 
perspective. The importance of the industry can be appraised, for example, from 
information on global box ofce for all flms released around the world that reached 
$38.3 billion in takings in 2015 (2015 theatrical statistics summary). In such a big 
industry, it is highly relevant to estimate how diferent flm features, such as genre, 
rating, and sequel, afect consumption preferences for American flms.
This paper estimates a hedonic model of revenues for 1431 American movies in 
45 non-American countries over the period 2002–2013. Hedonic models have been 
used in the motion picture literature to estimate the contribution of diferent flm 
features to revenues; see Walls and McKenzie (2012). Here, this basic framework is 
augmented by considering the impact of relevant country-level variables for a com prehensive group of nations. Such an extensive analysis is proven to be useful in 
estimating how indicators of geographical distance (GD) and cultural distance (CD) 
afect total revenue and the number of American flms exported to non-American 
countries, once the model specifcation also controls for relevant flm features. The 
literature on international trade, which will be more specifcally outlined in the next 
section,1
 has typically studied these issues at the aggregate country-level base. How ever, among the problems of this type of aggregate study, it is noteworthy that failing 
to develop an analysis at the flm level could result in a Simpson’s paradox problem, 
as the important inherent heterogeneity that is unobserved at the aggregate level is 
not taken into consideration. This is a typical problem in social science, whereby a 
characteristic that is present in disaggregate data disappears, or even reverses, for 
the aggregate counterpart; see Wagner (1982) for a discussion.
To preview, we fnd that indicators of CD and GD, in addition to the macroeco nomic indicator of the Human Development Index (HDI), signifcantly afect both 
revenue and the number of American flms. The latter is indirectly appraised based 
on the probability of theatrical release. This result is, in principle, not consistent 
with Hanson and Xiang (2011) who, in their highly insightful paper based on an 
extension of the theoretical model proposed by Melitz (2003), indicate that service 
products, unlike manufacturing products, are dominated by global, rather than bilat eral, fxed costs and are more likely to experience adjustment by revenues, while 
the number of flms exported is relatively fxed. However, it is also found that there 
is not a unique pattern of adjustment for all countries. In particular, countries with 
low levels of the HDI, there is a negative relationship between the probability of the 
arrival of a given flm and the expected revenue. This result can be explained if we 
consider that there could be restrictions on the demand for American flms in these 
types of countries. Conversely, there is a positive correlation between the probabil ity of flm arrival and expected revenue in developed countries. The analysis also

appraises the importance of flm features in the diferent groups of countries from 
the perspective of their degree of development and distance from the USA.
The next section discusses the previous economic literature pertaining to cinema. 
Section 3 presents the data used in the analysis and provides some relevant descrip tive statistics. Section 4 shows and discusses the estimation of the proposed hedonic 
model. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.
2 Literature review
Depending on the proposed theory and on the nature of the database used in the 
empirical analysis, economic papers related to the cinema industry, and, in general, 
to any service product, can be broken down into at least two main strands of the 
literature: (1) international trade and (2) industrial analysis of the diferent flm fea tures to explain success.
The frst group of papers focuses on analyzing how macroeconomic indicators, 
diferent measures of distance, and trade restrictions afect exports of service prod ucts. As suggested by Bernard and Jensen (1999) and Melitz (2003), a general para digm for manufacturing goods holds that, if frms are heterogeneous, the presence of 
high export costs would imply that only the most productive companies fnd that it 
is proftable to sell manufacturing goods abroad. This is consistent with the empiri cal evidence in Bernard et al. (2007) and Helpman et al. (2008), among others. In 
this context, Marvasti and Canterbery (2005) estimate a gravity-iceberg model of 
US export of motion pictures and fnd that spatial distance, together with other eco nomic and cultural variables, strongly infuences the US motion picture trade.
Hanson and Xiang (2011) emphasize the diferences between manufacturing and 
the service trade by extending the model in Melitz (2003) with both global and bilat eral fxed export costs. According to their framework, in an industry where global 
costs are more important than are bilateral costs, the ratio of import sales to product 
variety would decrease with trade barriers. On the other hand, if bilateral costs dom inate global costs, the main adjustment would be through output variety. Hanson 
and Xiang (2011) test this hypothesis using a sample of US motion picture exports 
for 46 countries over the period 1995–2006. Their results suggest that global fxed 
export costs dominate. The importance of trade restrictions for audio-visual services 
is also studied by Hellmanzik and Schmitz (2015) by means of a gravity model. 
They consider an indicator of cultural proximity based on the interest that other 
countries show in the web content of a country. Unlike Hanson and Xiang (2011), 
they cannot assess whether the adjustments to trade barriers occur in output variety 
or total sales. However, they also fnd that cultural proximity is an important deter minant of trade.
Compared to the literature above, an important contribution of this paper is that 
it considers flm-level information, rather than aggregate measures at the country 
level. This distinction is especially relevant because, as mentioned previously, it 
allows us to take the diferent heterogeneity sources observed at the flm level that 
704 J Cult Econ (2018) 42:701–716
1 3
could lead to misleading results at the aggregate level into account in the estima tion.2
 Moreover, the use of disaggregate information at the flm level allows us to 
control for the diferent country-level shocks in the regression.
The second big strand of the literature analyzes how diferent flm features afect 
consumer preferences. For example, Lee (2009) estimates how cultural diferences 
infuence the reception of US movies in East Asian countries. Although the research 
is specifc to the Asian region, it provides a highly insightful and rich analysis of 
the impact of diferent types of nominations and awards on the success of American 
movies for each country. Fu and Lee (2008) investigate the determinants of audience 
acceptance of foreign movies in Singapore. Interestingly, rather than focussing on 
the introduction of American flms in other countries, as most of the previous litera ture does, Fu and Lee analyze the patterns of consumption of movies with diferent 
nationalities in Singapore. They fnd that both cultural proximity and the price of 
a ticket play an important role in determining movie success. Palsson et al. (2013) 
study how flm rating infuences consumer and producer decisions for all domesti cally distributed flms in the USA for the period 1996–2009. They fnd that a mature 
rating reduces a movie’s box ofce revenue by 20%. Walls and Mckenzie (2012) 
study the demand for Hollywood movies in the USA and Canada and in six addi tional countries: Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Spain, and the UK. They 
identify the main determinants of the demand for Hollywood movies in each of 
these countries and fnd support for the hypothesis that the supply has been adapted 
to global demand after a decrease in the relative size of the US movie market.
An important diference between this research and the literature discussed above 
is that the analysis of consumer preferences for flms is extended to 45 countries, 
appraising the main determinants of consumption patterns, especially how they are 
infuenced by indicators of CD, social distance, and GD. Moreover, having such a 
big sample allows us to run separate regressions for diferent groups of countries, 
depending on their HDI and their CD from the USA. CD is time invariant and HDI 
can take diferent values in diferent years, but they are very stable through time. 
This allows us to classify countries according to their mean HDI values. This is 
especially useful in identifying diferent consumption patterns in diferent groups of 
countries.
3 Data
We collect information about 1392 US movies in 45 countries (excluding the US) 
over the period 2004–2013, in addition to indicators at the country level. However, 
as it will be explained in the following section, 2  years of variables will be used 
in the paper with the purpose of model identifcation reducing the total number of 
observations to 1152. The panel is unbalanced regarding the frst group of variables, 
as not every American flm is shown in each of the countries under analysis. Data on 
2 A remarkable exception to this is Holloway (2014), who, using information at the flm level, estimate 
the impact of quality on the propensity of a given movie entering a foreign market.

box ofce revenues are available from boxofcemojo.com. In addition, we consider 
several quantitative and qualitative variables for each of the flms in the sample. 
In particular, production budget (adjusted for infation, based on 2013) is obtained 
from numbers.com at the URL http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all. The 
variable nomination takes the value 1 if the flm has received an Academy Awards’ 
nomination in one or more of the main categories: best movie, best director, best 
actor or actress in a leading or supporting role, or best animation movie. Movie rat ings provide parents with advance information about the content of movies to help 
them determine what is appropriate for their children. They are used in our sample 
as a proxy of the content of a movie in terms of violence, sex, etc. We consider the 
following rating indicators: G stands for General Audiences, PG stands for Paren tal Guidance Suggested, PG-13 stands for Parental Guidance Strongly Cautioned; 
and R stands for Restricted, with Under 17 requiring accompaniment by a parent or 
adult guardian. Genre information is captured with the following set of binary dum mies: drama, comedy, action, and thriller. The variables sequel and sequel2 indicate 
whether the flm is either the frst sequel or a second or successive sequel of a previ ously released movie, respectively. Finally, the variable original indicates whether 
the movie is based on the writer’s own idea. We gather these data from opusdata.
com and imbd.com.
Same basic descriptive statistics of these variables, apart from budget and box 
ofce, are all dichotomous variables. Interestingly, budget varies greatly across 
flms, with a minimum value of 0.16 million dollars for the flm Once and a maxi mum of 336.9 million dollars for the flm Pirates of the Caribbean 3. All groups of 
genres and ratings are represented in the sample, although the most common genres 
are comedy and action, and 80% of the flms are either R or PG-13. This suggests 
that the sample contains a big range of diferent types of flms. Sequels make up 
approximately 10% of the sample, nominated flms make up approximately 10%, 
and original screenplays make up approximately 50%.
Table 1 reports some descriptive statistics for budget and log-box ofce in each 
of the 45 nations in our sample. The dynamic evolution of these two variables is not 
shown for the sake of brevity they show a stable behavior through time. When we 
turn our attention to country diferences, it can be observed that western developed 
countries such as the UK, Spain, Australia, and Germany are the main importers 
of American flms while developing countries such as China, India, Jamaica, and 
Kuwait are the ones who import the fewest number of American flms.
We consider two alternative country-level indicators to classify countries: the 
HDI and the CD. The HDI is an index created by the United Nations that summa rizes measures of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: 
standards of living, education, life expectancy, quality of life, and the per capita 
GDP for each country. This variable could be considered as an indicator of the 
potential demand for cultural products in a given country.
As discussed in the previous section, the literature on international trade consid ers CD indicators to account for trade between two countries. To capture informa tion about the CD between the USA and each of the countries in the sample, we fol low Lee (2009) and implement a value-based index developed by Hofstede (1980) 
that is built around four dimensions: (1) power distance, which expresses the degree

to which less powerful members of a society both accept and expect that power 
is distributed unequally; (2) uncertainty avoidance, which expresses the degree to 
which the members of a society feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambigu ity; (3) individualism versus collectivism; and (4) masculinity versus femininity. We 
gathered this information from Hofstede (2001), and each country’s CD from the 
USA was computed using Kogut and Singh (1988) formula:
where CDj
 is the CD of country j from the USA, Iij is the value for country j on 
the ith cultural dimension (Iiu for the US), and Vi
 is the variance of the ith cultural 
dimension. Finally, to evaluate GD we use data from CEPII’s GeoDist database3
 and 
weighted distances between countries calculated on bilateral distances of the biggest 
cities of two countries and on those inter-city distances being weighted by the share 
of the city in the country’s overall population.
Table 2 shows CD, GD, and HDI values for each of the nations considered in our 
analysis.
At it will be discussed later, countries can be clustered according to their relative 
position to these CD and HDI. Thus, although these three variables, CD, GD and 
HDI, are highly correlated it is still possible to fnd developing countries who are 
relatively close to the American culture as well as developed countries whose cul tural values are very diferent from the American ones.
Using information by countries, it is interesting to observe whether there is some 
correlation between average log revenues and the log number of movies exhibited 
in each country. This is shown in Fig. 1. The graph suggests a slightly positive cor relation between the two variables. However, it is not possible to draw a sound eco nomic conclusion from this fgure as we are mixing a very heterogeneous group of 
flms. A more complete analysis should control for the diferent flm features that 
can afect both the probability of flm arrival and box ofce revenues.

4 Empirical analysis
We analyze the factors afecting both the revenues from and the arrival of difer ent American flms in 45 diferent countries (excluding the USA) by estimating 
a hedonic model of revenues; see Walls and McKenzie (2012) and the references 
therein. A general approach in the literature is to explain flm success as a func tion of production budgets, awards, and diferent characteristics of the flm, such as 
sequels, genre, and content. This approach is particularly sound when it is applied to

countries other than the USA, because the diferent explanatory indicators can gen erally be considered as exogenous with respect to the flm revenues in each foreign 
country, even though they may fail to be exogenous in the American market (due to 
efects caused by the expected revenue).
As each movie is observed in 1 year only, it is not possible to specify a dynamic 
panel model. Therefore, our baseline specifcation explains the revenue of a flm in 
a country j (in logs and adjusted for infation) as a function of three main groups 
of variables: (1) indicators for the flm quality, the budget, and award nominations, 
where the former is a measure of the production efort and the latter is a proxy of the 
artistic quality; (2) variables related to the diferent features of the flm to determine 
how these features impact its success; and (3) a national trend component. More over, the use of a disaggregate approach allows us to control for all the potential 
unobserved heterogeneity at the country level, such as total production or demand 
in the national movie industry or the degree of protective legislation for the national 
industry, by including country/year fxed efects. The following model is considered:
where i, j, and t stand for flm, country, and year, respectively; the terms βr for 
r=1–11 are parameters of the model, γjt is the specifc country-year fxed efect, and 
ɛij is an error term. All the variables in the model have been defned in the previous 
section but note that variables PG13i
 and comedyi
 are left outside of the age rating 
and genre groups, respectively, to avoid perfect multicolinearity.
Note also that the model above is particularly suitable for dealing with a poten tial selection bias problem as the country/year component already controls for the 
impact of any specifc unobserved variable on the arrival of an American flm at the 
country level. However, we explore further the possibility of an endogenous sample 
selection that could be due to some flm-specifc shadow costs or features. This may 
lead to inconsistent estimates of the coefcients in a model that accounts for flm 
revenues if the shocks that afect the probability that a given movie is exhibited in 
a certain country are highly correlated with the shocks that determine its revenue. 
Based on this premise, we employ Heckman’s (1979) two-step methodology. In the 
frst step, we estimate a probit model (selection equation) for the probability that 
a flm is exhibited in a given country. This approach allows us to obtain the Mills 
ratios that are necessary to correct the OLS estimates of the primary equation in 
stage two.
To identify the model, it is necessary to choose at least one variable to be 
included in the selection equation only at the frst stage. However, it is a difcult 
task to fnd such a variable, given that the probability of arrival of a given flm and 
its expected revenue are typically afected by similar shocks. Moreover, the selection 
of one variable to afect the former but not the latter can only be based on specu lative arguments. For example, Walls and McKenzie (2012) consider the revenue 
from opening week in the USA as the identifcation variable. Although this could

be judged as a plausible option, in principle, the decision as to which countries will 
show a given flm has already been made by the time of the opening week in the 
USA in most cases. Moreover, this variable is very likely to be highly correlated 
with the expected revenue of the flm, as the specifc factors that afect flm revenues 
in the USA are, in principle, like those afecting flm revenues in other countries.
As the identifcation variable, we propose an indicator that takes value one if the 
most similar movie in terms of the regressors in model (2) 2 years before was exhib ited in that country. The concept of most similar movie was applied by adopting the 
K-nearest neighbor approach; see, for example, Altman (1992). It can be defned as 
the group of flms whose covariates minimize the canonical distance from the flm 
under analysis. Thus, we can identify similar movies across the sample, given their 
quality and idiosyncratic features, such as genre, content, and sources.
To implement the nearest neighbor, the frst 2  years of the dataset (2003 and 
2004) are drawn out of the sample and used as a training population to instruct the 
algorithm, thus reducing the test sample to 1152 movies. We consider a dummy var iable that takes the value 1 if the most similar movie was released in the same coun try in the previous 2 years. We also tested for broader neighbors, k=3 and k=5, and 
we did not fnd any improvement in the quality of our analysis.4
The time lag (2 years) is set based on the average time of production of a movie, 
so that production companies can react properly to the performance of previously 
released flms and strategically choose what types of movies to promote in diferent 
markets.
Of course, it can always be argued that these flm features, even in other flms, 
could be correlated with the expected revenue of the flm. However, it is not true 
that all the flms with the same features, i.e., belonging to the same genre, rating, 
uniquely determine a high percentage of the variation in revenues. If that were the 
case, only some specifc types of flms would be seen in the market. Moreover, an 
identifcation variable based on features of other flms that were released 2  years 
before is, in principle, less likely to be correlated with its expected revenue than is 
an identifcation variable obtained from the same flm.
The frst two columns of Table 3 show the estimation results of model (1) in a 
pool regression for the 45 countries in the sample for both the selection and primary 
equations. The statistical signifcance of the coefcient associated with the inverse 
Mills ratio suggests that it is indeed appropriate to correct for selection bias. Its neg ative sign is consistent with the assumption that, in some countries, the size of the 
demand for some specifc types of American movies is constrained, which implies 
that a saturation of the market can occur, thus lowering the expected revenue for 
each movie exhibited.
To control for the potential correlation of the error term in the primary and the 
selection equations, we also considered the Mundlak–Chamberlain approach, 
as proposed by Wooldridge (2010); however, there was no qualitative change in 
the estimated results. In this paper, for the sake of brevity, we show our baseline

specifcation, which is based on a unique estimated inverse Mills ratio for the entire 
sample period.
When we look at movie-specifc variables, the relevant and positive impact of 
covariates on quality (production budget and Academy Awards nominations) can 
be observed in both the probability of exhibition and the revenue. As for genres, a 
global preference for action and thriller movies emerges, with respect to the refer ence category of comedies. This result is consistent with the fndings of Lee (2009) 
and the empirical evidence (see The Economist 2011)5
 that American humor does 
not sell well in markets with a broad CD from the USA. Moreover, the positive

impact that sequels and subsequent movies in a series have on revenues confrms 
the validity of Hollywood’s strategy of investing in existing intellectual proprieties, 
rather than introducing new, original products into the market. The validity of this 
strategy is supported by the small magnitude of the coefcient associated with origi nal screenplays that refer to movies in which the plot and characters are not part of a 
previous intellectual propriety (e.g., books, comics, or video games).
We augmented the baseline model by including some typical indicators of dis tance that have also been considered in the literature, in addition to HDI, CD, and 
geographic distance in both the primary and the selection equations, with the aim 
of apprising the relative importance of these variables in relation to revenue and the 
probability of arrival of a flm in a non-American country. This regression, which is 
used to obtain an initial appraisal on the relative importance of the diferent distance 
indicators, does not include year-time fxed efects to avoid perfect multicollinearity 
with HDI. The results of this estimation are shown in columns 3 and 4 of Table 3. 
As discussed in Sect.  2, according to Hanson and Xiang (2011), distance indica tors should exert a more signifcant impact on the intensive margin (primary equa tion) than in the number of released US flms, which is appraised here based on the 
selection equation in Table 3. Note in this respect that an important diference with 
Hanson and Xiang (2011) is that we consider an estimation at the flm level taking 
into consideration the impact of diferent flm features on the probability of theatri cal release rather than estimating the total number of flms only as a function of 
country-level variables.
GD is only signifcant in the primary equation, while CD is a relevant variable in 
both equations. This result suggests that CD represents a more important bilateral 
fxed shadow cost of introducing a movie in a given country than GD. In addition, 
the estimated model suggests that not only distance indicators but also the degree of 
development of a country are important variables in determining both the number of 
flms exhibited and their expected revenues.
However, as the descriptive statistics in Sect. 3 suggest, CD and HDI alone are 
not sufcient to explain movie success. This is confrmed here by the associated t
statistics. This issue is further explored by disentangling the R2
 of the regression 
by groups of variables following a Shapley value analysis; see Huettner and Sunder 
(2012). Results indicate that country characteristics (CD, HDI, and GD) globally 
account for less than 1% of the R2
, while the inverse Mills ratio, which represents 
the selection hazard, explains 23% of the variance in revenue and movie-related var iables explain 77%. These results clearly suggest the importance of controlling by 
flm features in the analysis.
Previous results do not exclude the possibility of diferent types of adjustments 
at the intensive and extensive margins for diferent clusters of countries. However, 
a main problem with HDI and CD (the most signifcant indicators of distance) is 
that they are highly negatively correlated.6
 To deal with this issue, we break down 
the total sample of countries into four groups, according to their relative HDI 
6 In a regression between these two variables, the coefcient associated to CD is −0.02 with a p value 
equal to 0.048. However, the coefcient of a regression between CD and GD is insignifcant, p=0.81.

and CD values:(1) low CD and low HDI, (2) low CD and high HDI, (3) high 
CD and low HDI, and (4) high CD and high HDI. A complete list of the coun tries belonging to each of these groups, together with a separate estimation of 
the baseline model for each case, can be found in Table 4. Note that this equation 
includes country-year fxed efect to control for unobserved country-level fuc tuations such as tarifs or any other type of macroeconomic policy. Although the 
econometric specifcation follows an empirical approach, the theoretical insight 
is that consumer preferences of American flms in a given country are afected by 
its cultural distance with respect to the USA as well as its degree of human and 
economic development.
The results from the probit model estimation are not reported in this case, for 
the sake of brevity, but the results show that the qualitative impact of all the vari ables is like their estimated efect in the primary equation.
Interestingly, the negative sign in the inverse Mills ratio observed at the 
aggregate level can only be found for countries either with low CD and low HDI 
or high CD and low HDI. A plausible explanation is that the saturation in the 
number of flms is especially relevant in relatively poor countries with a low

development index. For the groups of countries with high HDI, there is either a 
positive inverse Mills ratio or no sample selection.
Results concerning the importance of flm features by groups of countries are 
also very helpful in enabling decision makers determine which countries to tar get for each type of flm. Just paying attention to the size of the estimated coef fcients, variables related to flm quality such as budget and nomination exert the 
highest impact on revenues. Turning the attention to the statistical signifcance of 
the parameter estimates, flm quality indicators (budget and nomination) always 
have a positive and signifcant impact on revenues for the four groups; however, 
the magnitude of the impact of these two variables is bigger for countries with 
high HDI. Sequels are well received in countries that are close to the American 
culture (low CD), while a second or subsequent sequel is especially successful in 
high HDI countries. The reason for this could be that only people who are famil iar with American culture are interested in the frst sequel of a flm, while a sec ond or subsequent sequel of a given flm means that it is sufciently famous eve rywhere, and its success is mainly determined by the degree of development of 
the country. Conversely, original screenplay movies have a more positive impact 
in countries with a high CD.
In relation to genres, low HDI countries tend to show a strong preference for 
thrillers and a dislike for drama while high CD tends to countries like action. This 
result seems plausible, given that people with a very diferent culture likely fnd 
action movies easier to understand than other genres. Finally, the mildest movies (G 
rating) are preferred by countries with low CD and high HDI.
5 Concluding remarks
We have estimated how American flm revenues, in 45 countries, are afected by 
both flm features and variables, such as distance indicators and the HDI, at the 
country level. This analysis has three important results: (1) both flm features and 
country-level variables signifcantly afect revenues; (2) patterns of flm consump tions are diferent for countries, depending on their CD from the USA and their HDI; 
and (3) diferent flm features are appreciated in diferent ways in diferent countries. 
It is also very remarkable that, in general, distance indicators infuence both adjust ment in revenue and in the number of flms that arrive in diferent countries. Han son and Xiang (2011) fnd that revenue adjustments are more important when using 
aggregate data at the country level; this fact warrants further investigation in future 
research. Overall, our results suggest that trade analysis at the country level allows 
us to control for the diferent sources of heterogeneity that are potentially present in 
the model.
Three potential extensions for future works are: (1) to extend this type of research 
to other cultural products to see whether results are consistent in other context; (2) to 
develop theoretical foundations to explain the diferent trade adjustments in difer ent clusters of countries; and (3) to explore further the reasons why diferent genres 
could be subject to diferent cultural discounting.
