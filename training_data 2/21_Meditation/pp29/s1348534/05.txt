Abstract
Background: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes are chronic diseases, which generally require lifetime care. Meditation and yoga
can be complementary to pharmacological therapies according to the scientific evidences so far. Brain education-based meditation
(BEM) is a technique, which has been known to change brain structure, psychology, and physiology of healthy adult participants. This
randomized, nonblinded pilot trial aimed to examine whether BEM affects the conditions of patients with hypertension and/or type 2
diabetes compared with health education classes.
Methods: We randomly allocated 48 patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes to BEM (n=24) or health education (n=24)
classes in the Ulsan Junggu Public Health Center in Korea, where the classes were run during the same period and explored the impact
of 8-week practice on the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, gamma glutamyl
transpeptidase, creatinine, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Total RNA was extracted
to examine inflammatory gene expressions from the whole blood using PAXgene blood RNA System. In addition, self-reports on mental/
physical health were evaluated. The Student’s t test, chi-squared test, and analysis of covariance were used for statistical analysis.
Results: The number of people who participated until the completion of the study was 14 in the control and 21 in the BEM group.
After 8 weeks, LDL cholesterol level was significantly decreased in the BEM group after the intervention (13.82mg/dL reduction,
P<.05), while it was not significantly altered in the control group. The expression of inflammatory genes was significantly reduced
after 8 weeks of the BEM training (0.3-, 0.5-, and 0.2-fold change for NFKB2, RELA, and IL1B, respectively, all P<.05). In the item
analysis of mental/physical health self-reports, a significant improvement was confirmed as follows: increases in focus, confidence,
relaxation, and happiness; decreases in fatigue, anger, and loneliness (all P<.05). There were no important adverse events or sideeffects by BEM intervention.
Conclusion: Compared to health education, BEM helps lower LDL cholesterol level and the inflammatory gene expression in the
patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes. Moreover, BEM induces positive effects on the self-reported mental/physical
states, warranting further study.

1. Introduction
There were 1.13 billion people worldwide with high blood
pressure in 2015[1] and 422 million people with diabetes in
2014,[2] respectively. Hypertension and type 2 diabetes can cause
other fatal complications. For example, pooled data from 54
countries show that at least 80% of cases of end-stage renal
disease are caused by diabetes, hypertension, or a combination of
the 2.[3] Furthermore, adults with diabetes have a 2 or 3 times
higher rate of cardiovascular disease than adults without
diabetes.[4]
Many evidences have shown that stress affects the risk of the
hypertension. Temporary increase in blood pressure appears as
part of the immediate response to stress; exposure to stress for
long period may contribute to the development of persistent
hypertension.[5] Indeed, stress increases the sympathetic nervous
activity, for example, elevation of blood pressure.[6,7] In addition,
stress affects the risks of type 2 diabetes. Activation of the
physiologic stress response from chronic exposure to stressors,
low socioeconomic status, severe mental health problems, or
aggressive behavior increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.[8]
Exposure to chronic stressors lead to health-adverse behaviors
and physiologic stress response, resulting in chronic subclinical
inflammation, followed by central obesity, insulin resistance,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, and depression, eventually causing
type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.[8]
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol contributes to fat
accumulation in arteries; this narrows the arteries, induces
hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases; LDL
cholesterol-lowering therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular
disease.[9] In the action of drugs for type 2 diabetes, LDL was
found to be included in the mechanism, suggesting the close
relations between type 2 diabetes and LDL.[10] Moreover
interestingly, LDL seems also affected by higher function of
human brain. Chronic work stress elevates serum LDL
cholesterol in an occupationally homogeneous group of healthy
middle-aged men.[11] Moreover, higher LDL cholesterol was
found in participants with higher self-perceived stress scores.[12]
These studies imply the relationship between stress and LDL
cholesterol.
In inflammation, nuclear factor kappa B subunit (NF-kB)
family is activated by canonical and noncanonical signaling
pathways. The noncanonical NF-kB pathway, which includes
NFKB2 and RELB, has been revealed to be involved with
metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.[13–15]
Psychological stress contributes to chronic activation of acutephase inflammation.[16] As mentioned above, stress increases the
risk of hypertension/type 2 diabetes. Inflammation has been
shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes[17] and hypertension.[18]
Brain education-based meditation (BEM) is a training system
applying 5 steps of brain education (BE), which is a modernized
method of traditional mind–body training in Korea[19] and has
been also known as brain wave vibration meditation.[20–31] Since
BEM has both the characteristics of yoga and meditation, it is
involved in the improvement of both physical and mental features
of participants. Its effects have been investigated in various
settings such as randomized controlled trials for novice or crosssectional studies for long-term meditators; off/online training;
healthy individuals, and breast cancer patients. They include
psychological improvements such as decreases in stress,[24]
anxiety,[28] depression,[23] fatigue[28] and increases in positive
effect,[24] quality of life[28]; behavioral improvements such as
increases in sleep quality,[22,23] problem solving[31]; physiological
effects such as increases in plasma nitric oxide,[21] dopamine,[24]
and interleukin 10[30]; brain structural changes such as
thickening of prefrontal cortex area[27] and alterations in
conectivities between insula and several brain regions.[20]
Findings in certain psychological improvements indicate its
association with epigenetic changes.[26,29]
Since mental health significantly affects hypertension and type
2 diabetes,[8] BEM, which improves mental health, may have
beneficial effects on the physiology of the diseases. People with
hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes should control the body
condition throughout their lifetime, and nonpharmacological
interventions can be used as complementary treatments. This
suggests that mind–body interventions such as BEM may be
beneficial. However, there have been no studies of BEM on
patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes. Herein, we
performed a randomized controlled pilot trial to investigate the
effectiveness of BEM on physiological and psychological changes
in people with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes under
medication.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
University of Brain Education (IRB201709-01) and informed
consents were obtained for experimentation with all the
participants. The participants with hypertension and/or type 2
diabetes under regular medication, aged 57 to 87 years, were
recruited among registered patients in the Hypertension/Diabetes
Registration Education Center of the Ulsan Junggu Public Health
Center in Republic of Korea through advertisements over 1
month (September 2017). Excluded were people who have other
diseases except hypertension/type 2 diabetes. Forty-nine participants were recruited and 1 person declined to participate because
of the schedule. They were simply randomized into 2 groups by a
computer-generated list of random numbers, each including 24
people. Thirty-five participants (BEM: 21; control: 14) completed
the study, with 13 dropouts (BEM: 3; control: 10). The dropouts
said their schedules do not fit the experimental schedule (2
controls) or they do not have interests (BEM: 3; control: 8)
(Supplemental Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MD/C971).
For inflammatory gene expression analysis, a matched group
design was used: 9 people were equally selected from the aboverandomized groups in terms of sex, diseases, and age (Table 5).
Fourteen participants (BEM: 8; control: 6) completed the study,
with 4 dropouts (BEM: 1; control: 3). The dropouts said they do
not have interests.
Random allocation sequence was generated by the researchers.
Staffs of the Ulsan Junggu Public Health Center, who do not
know the detail of the research, enrolled participants and
assigned participants to interventions.
2.2. Interventions
The participants allocated to the BEM group attended BEM
classes, designed to improve the conditions of patients of
hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes, 16 times during 8 weeks
(twice per week, from October 10, 2017 to December 1, 2017),
while the participants in the control group participated in the
health education class provided by the Ulsan Junggu Public
Health Center. The BEM classes were taught by a certified
BRAIN TRAINER (Korean Government Certification 2016-14),
who is a trained instructor for BEM. The BEM classes basically
followed as described previously[23] with slight modifications;
each week has an individual topic following BE 5 steps
(Supplemental Content 3, http://links.lww.com/MD/C971).
The attendance of participants was taken care of by the
education center during the study. Full protocols are available
from the authors on request.
2.3. Blood preparations and biochemical measurements
Venous blood was collected by phlebotomy with butterfly needle
from subjects with their consent in the Ulsan Junggu Public
Health Center. Excessive exercise, herbal medicine, and fasting
were prohibited for 1 week before the blood collection, as well as
during the experimental period. Sampling was performed after 8
hours of fasting. Blood was collected into serum separating tube
(5mL) and PAXgene tube (2.5mL blood + 6.9 mL buffer). All the
samples were inverted 10 times immediately after the collection.
Serum separating tubes underwent centrifugation and serum was
collected to measure serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
(SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), g-glutamyl transferase (GGT), creatinine, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. The biochemical
measurements were performed on the same day in the pathology
laboratory of the Ulsan Junggu Public Health Center by COBAS
INTEGRA 400 PLUS/800 analyzers. PAXgene RNA tubes were
transferred in room temperature to the University of Brain
Education on the same day and stored at 80°C upon arrival
until RNA isolation.
2.4. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction
For this purpose, initially 9 participants per group were selected
by matching sex, diseases, and age (Table 5). Because of the high
expense of the experiment, not all the participants were included
for RNA extraction, followed by cDNA synthesis and qPCR.
Among them, 6 and 8 participants in the control and BEM
groups, respectively, completed the designed study (Table 6). For
RNA isolation, the frozen blood samples were returned to room
temperature, and procedures followed the “Purification of Total
RNA from human whole Blood Collected into PAXgene Blood
RNA Tubes” protocol in the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit
Handbook (PreAnalytiX GmbH, 08/2005, REF: 762174),
including a DNAse treatment. cDNA was synthesized from
0.5mg total RNA using the Super Script IV Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Cat No. 18090010, Carlsbad, California) following
the manufacturer’s guidelines with Oligo-dT primer. For qPCR,
each reaction comprised of 7.5mL 2 PowerUp SYBR Green
Master Mix (A25780, Applied biosystems, Waltham, MA), 0.9m
L 10mM primer mix, 1.6mL ultrapure water, and 5mL cDNA
(1:10). Samples were then amplified on an ABI StepOnePlus.
Following specific primer sets were used for each gene: NFKB2
(forward, 50

CATCGTCA-30
; reverse, 50
-TAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAAC30
). ACTB was used as a reference gene. All the reactions were
carried out in triplicate.
2.5. Mental/physical health self-reports
Self-report questionnaires were used in this study to assess mental
and physical health. The questionnaires were reconstructed on
the basis of the Personality Assessment Inventory[32] and
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.[33] In particular,
the scales were validated for the elderly, based on the dynamic
aspects of everyday life and the static aspects of the individual life
cycle. Both mental and physical health self-reports are composed
of 20 items, using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from “1 =
strongly disagree” to “5 = strongly agree.” In the scoring
calculation, positive items (Table 3: Item no. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11,
12, 14, 17, 18, 20; Table 4: Item no. 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13) were
reversed scored so that lower scores reflect a healthier state and
they can be included in the total scale scores. The internal
consistency for the scales in the study was acceptable with
Cronbach alpha values 0.93 (mental health) and 0.86 (physical
health).
2.6. Statistical data analysis
All data analyses were done in blind manner without knowing the
group information. Analyses for self-reports and blood tests were
conducted with the SPSS 18.0 software package (IBM, Seoul). Chisquared (for gender and disease) and independent samples t tests
(for age, self-reports, biochemical analysis, and inflammatory gene
expression analysis) were performed to assess the success of
randomization and examine pretest differences between groups.
The statistical significance of pre–post differences within each
group and between groups was verified by paired samples t tests
and independent samples t tests. Statistical values of the Welch–
Aspin test were used when Levene’s equivariant was not assumed
in the independent samples t test. When the postscores between
groups were statistically significant by independent samplest tests,
with low P value of the prescore (.05<P<1.00), the difference
between groups was finally analyzed by analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA), which controls prescores.
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of blood biochemical characteristics
between meditation and control group
In this pilot study, to find out the complementary effects of BEM
on the health state of the patients, subjects who have diagnosed
with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes under medication
participated in either BEM or health education class, both of
which were run by the public healthcare center during the same
period. The subjects were randomly allocated into 2 groups
(Table 1, Supplemental Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MD/
C971). The numbers of people who participated in the
premeasurement were 24 (BEM) and 22 (control), and there
were no significant differences in the ratio of sex (50% each),
disease (P=.42, chi-squared test), and age (P=.36, independent
samplest test) between them. The period after the initial diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes and hypertension was 8.84±2.94 and 8.94±

2.39 years, respectively, for BEM; 5.02±2.01 and 8.00±2.59
years, respectively, for control (average ± standard error of the
mean, Supplemental Content 2, http://links.lww.com/MD/
C971). There were no significant differences in the baseline
scores of the groups for mental and physical health scores, SGOT,
SGPT, GGT, creatinine, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, as examined
by independent samples t test (Table 1). There were 3 (BEM) and
8 (control) dropouts, resulting in 21 (BEM) and 14 (control)
participants for the final analysis (Table 2). The BEM group with
high attendance (BEM [Att≥5]) was analyzed additionally.
There were no significant differences in the premeasurement of
the above-mentioned parameters between the control and BEM
group (or BEM [Att≥5]) (Table 2).
The results showed no significant changes between BEM and
control, as well as between preintervention and postintervention
of each group in SGOT, SGPT, GGT, creatinine, and HDL
cholesterol (Table 2). However, LDL level in the total BEM group
was significantly reduced after the intervention (13.82mg/dL
reduction, #
P=.04, paired samples t test, n=21) (Table 2,
Fig. 1H). The D LDL cholesterol level (=LDL [post]  LDL [pre])
was significantly lower in the BEM (Att≥5) (∗
P=.04, independent samples t test, Fig. 1H) as well as the total BEM group
(
∗
P=.01, independent samples t test, Fig. 1H) than the control
group, while other markers did not show significant changes
(Fig. 1A–G).
3.2. Comparison of self-report scores between meditation
and control group
To check whether the BEM program affects the mental and
physical health state, the subjects were asked to complete selfreport questionnaires. In the physical health self-report, the score
of 1 item “I always feel tired” showed significant reductions
(better physical health) after the intervention (BEM=2.76±0.77
[n=21], Cont=3.36±0.93 [n=14], P=.04, independent samples t test), while other items did not show significant changes
(Table 3). When the mental health scores were compared between
preintervention and postintervention, there were significant
reductions in scores (meaning better mental health) only in the
BEM group for the following items (Table 4): “I feel
comfortable” (pre=3.24±1.00, post=2.76±0.94, P=.03,
paired samples t test, n=21), “Sometimes I get angry without
a reason” (pre=2.52±0.93, post=2.14±0.65, P=.02, paired
sample t test, n=21), and “These days are the happiest days in my
life” (pre=3.10±0.77, post=2.76±0.70, P=.01, paired samples t test, n=21). When the mental health scores of postintervention between BEM and control were compared, there
were significant reductions (thus, better mental health) in the
BEM group than in the control group in the following items:
“Sometimes I get angry without a reason” (BEM=2.14±0.65
[n=21], Cont=2.79±1.12 [n=14], P=.04, independent samples t test), “Sometimes my thoughts are all mixed up” (BEM=
2.38±0.59 [n=21], Cont=3.14±0.77 [n=14], P<.01, independent samples t test), “No one is close to me” (BEM=2.14±
0.65 [n=21], Cont=3.07±1.21 [n=14], P=.01, independent
samples t test), and “I have a confidence that I can do anything”
(BEM=2.52±0.81 [n=21], Cont=3.50±0.94 [n=14], P<.01,
independent samples t test). ANCOVA was performed for
following 2 items with low P value (.05<P<.10) in the prescores
between groups: “No one is close to me” (ANCOVA SS(I)=2.60,
df=1, F=4.34, P=.04) and “I have a confidence that I can do
anything” (ANCOVA SS(I)=3.38, df=1, F=6.20, P=.01). The
results indicate that BEM has significant reductions in mental
scores (thus, better mental health) in both items. To summarize,
BEM intervention was beneficial for physical health in terms of
fatigue relief (item no. 9). Moreover, it was beneficial for mental
health in the following aspects: increases in relaxation (item no.
1), focus (item no. 5), happiness (item no. 7), and confidence (item

“BEM (Att≥5)” presents BEM group with high attendance rate: more than 5 times of attendance. Chi-squared was used to test the sex homogeneity between groups (BEM vs control). It was not performed in
“BEM (Att≥5)” group, because of a small sample size (n=4 for male and 4 for female). Student independent t tests were conducted to contrast the mean value differences between groups (BEM (Att≥5) vs
control or BEM vs control) at preintervention and postintervention. Paired sample t tests were performed to compare the means from the same group of different time points (pre vs post). A lower score in the selfreports is associated with a healthier state of the body.

3.3. Comparison of inflammatory gene expression
between meditation and control group
Inflammatory conditions are associated with type 2 diabetes,[34]
as well as hypertension,[35] which suggest that inflammation
participates in the pathogenesis of the diseases. To know whether
inflammatory markers are changed by the intervention, we
performed qPCR on cDNA synthesized from RNA derived from
the whole peripheral blood at preintervention and postintervention. Nine participants for gene expression analysis were selected
by matching sex, disease, and age from each group. Baseline
characteristics of sex, diseases, and age between groups were
comparable (Table 5). Among them, 8 participants for BEM and
6 participants for control completed the study. They did not show
significant differences in mental/physical health self-report scores
as well as blood biochemical analysis (Table 6). However, there
were significant changes in inflammatory gene expression level
between preintervention and postintervention by meditation
training (Fig. 2). We investigated NFKB2 and RELB for
noncanonical NF-kB pathway, RELA for canonical NF-kB
pathway,[36] and IL1B which is a risk factor for type 2
diabetes.[37] Because of the changes in temperature between
preintervention and postintervention which may affect the gene
expression, we normalized the ACTB-normalized gene expression of BEM group by the correspondence of control group of the
same time point. As a result, the expressions of NFKB2, RELA,
and IL1B were significantly reduced by meditation training
(Fig. 2A, B, D: NFKB2, 0.3-fold change, ∗

4. Discussion
Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are diseases which demand
continuous lifetime care because of their notorious complications.[38,39] Since they require lifetime care, nondrug approaches
are pursued to manage long-term health care. This study is the
first randomized controlled trial using BEM, whose subjects are
patients of hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes. The purpose of
the study is to investigate the effectiveness of 8-week BEM
intervention, as a complementary care to a conventional drug
treatment. Our results showed that the use of BEM with drug
therapy is significantly more effective than drug-only therapy in
certain aspects.
Plasma lipids and lipoproteins such as LDL are among the most
important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.[40] In the meta
analyses of data from 170,000 participants in 26 randomized
trials, the reduction of major vascular event is directly
proportional to the absolute LDL reduction, even if LDL
cholesterol is lower than 2.0mmol/L (=77.34mg/dL).[41] If there
is a nonpharmacological way to lower LDL cholesterol, it can be
a useful complementary method for patients with chronic
hypertension/diabetes to maintain their health state and prevent
potential complications. BEM program significantly reduced the
concentration of LDL cholesterol in the serum of the subjects
(Table 2, Fig. 1). Although the mechanism is unknown, the
current beneficial effect of BEM on cardiovascular diseases is
consistent with a previous finding; the amount of plasma nitric
oxide is twice higher in the BEM group than in the control
group.[21] Since established cardiovascular risk factors such as
hypertension and diabetes mellitus decrease endothelial NO
production,[42] its increase in plasma level suggests beneficial
effects of NO on potential prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to a recent systemic review,[43] 7 of 8 randomized
controlled trials (total 838 participants) using yoga-based
programs reported significant beneficial changes in serum lipids,
including a significant decline in LDL, compared to standard
care, group education, or a moderate intensity exercise program.
However, LDL level is not significantly changed in several
meditation studies, including 12-week Buddhist walking meditation,[44] and a community-based mind–body meditative Tai Chi
program.[45] Sometimes yoga-based program includes more
physical activity than static regular meditation. BEM has
combinatory features, which include dynamic physical activities
as well as mental meditative characters.[23] Considering the
above-mentioned yoga, meditative techniques, and BEM, it is
interesting to predict that the reduction of LDL cholesterol may
be associated with techniques that use more dynamic physical
activities than relatively static meditation, if the subjects are
novice meditators, which is the case for most randomized
controlled studies. This is because novice meditators may have
difficulties in reaching the level of experienced meditators who
can quickly change their metabolism by simple breathing or
walking mediation alone. On the contrary, novice meditators can
relatively easily follow dynamic physical activities, which may
induce physiological changes on the limited training period.
Subjects in the current pilot study did not have previous
experiences on meditation; the characteristics of BEM containing
both dynamic and static activities seem to contribute to induce
the alterations in physiology-lowering LDL cholesterol level—
during the limited training period.
Data have suggested that low-grade inflammations play a role
in the development and progression of hypertension and endorgan damage.[18] Moreover, the role of inflammation in the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications is
now well understood.[34] Clinical studies are using antiinflammatory approaches to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.
Its mechanisms of action include the inhibition of NF-kB
pathway and IL-1b.
[34] The reductions in the expression level of
NFKB2, RELA, and IL1B by BEM practice (Fig. 2) suggest
BEM may reverse low-grade inflammation occurring in patients
with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes. The other blood
biochemical markers did not show significant changes in these
patients (Table 6). This may be derived from the different
sensitivity of the detection method: biochemical analysis using
serum (Table 6) and real-time PCR using cDNA synthesized
from blood RNA (Fig. 2). The current result of inhibitory effects
of NF-kB family expression by BEM (Fig. 2) is also consistent
with a previous BEM study which showed the increase of
plasma NO,[21] which inhibits NF-kB-mediated gene expression.[46,47] The reduced expression of pro-inflammatory IL1B
by BEM training is also consistent with the previous finding
which showed the increased expression of anti-inflammatory
IL10 by BEM,[30] which suggests that BEM helps reduce
inflammation. Our results suggest that BEM training reduces
low-grade inflammation by reducing the expression of NF-kB,
RELA, and IL1B.
Studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes have
poorer general mental health,[48] and are more likely to be alcohol
dependent,[49] and have more cognitive decline and dementia,[50]
compared with those who do not have type 2 diabetes. Reversely,
Joseph and Golden proposed that psychological stress contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes through alterations in
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic
nervous system, and immune system.[51] Depression and
depressive symptoms elevate the risk for progressive insulin
resistance[52] and diabetes.[53] Moreover, it is clear that
hypertension increases one’s risk of cognitive decline and
dementia.[54] These suggest a correlation between mental health
and diabetes/hypertension. In the current study, mental health
self-report score suggests that BEM significantly improves
relaxation, focus, happiness, and confidence; decreases anger,
and loneliness in patient with hypertension and/or diabetes
(Table 4). This is consistent with previous findings of the
beneficial effects of BEM on mental health of healthy individuals:
reductions in stress,[23,24,26,31] depression,[21,23] anxiety,[21,28]
neuroticism[29]; increases in extraversion and openness to
experience,[29] positive effect,[24] quality of life,[28] problem
solving, emotional intelligence, and resilience.[31] The positive
effects of BEM on mental health indicate its beneficial use in
patients with diabetes to prevent diabetes-related complications
related with cognitive decline. In the physical health self-report
score, BEM significantly relieves the feeling of fatigue (Table 3).
This is consistent with a result from the previous research
performed on breast cancer patients.[28] Improvement in sleep
quality by BEM may contribute to the relief of fatigue.[22,23]
When the brain perceives the environment as stress, HPA axis
and sympathetic nervous system are activated. If it becomes
chronic, various psychological symptoms, changes in metabolism, immune system are led to development of diseases[55]
(Supplemental Content 4A, http://links.lww.com/MD/C971). In
the current research, BEM training reduces the chronic activation
through reducing stress itself by changing the way of thinking.
Moreover, it induces balanced recovery of automatic nervous
system by activating parasympathetic nervous system through
breathing. The indicated main observations of the current study
are supposed to be led by those mechanisms (Supplemental
Content 4B, http://links.lww.com/MD/C971).
The present study has following limitations. Since this is a pilot
study, the number of subjects is relatively small. To validate the
current results, a follow-up study is needed with a larger sample
size as well as measurements of other related components such as
body mass index and hemoglobin A1c. BEM includes static
meditation as well as dynamic elements. To know which element
contributed to the current results, not only education control but
also element-corresponding controls will be needed. The drug
type was not controlled since the subject registration was
performed in the public healthcare center not in the clinic where
each subject was prescribed for his/her disease. Therefore, there is
a possibility that the drug types might affect the results, with
different molecular mechanisms. The subjects include both
hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Although their correlation is
well known, it is desirable to investigate each condition
separately in the future study with a larger number of subjects
to see the specific effects of BEM on each disease.
5. Conclusions
In this pilot randomized controlled trial, our results showed that
8-week-BEM training reduces LDL cholesterol and inflammatory
gene expression and improves some elements of the investigated
physical/mental health of patients with type 2 diabetes/hypertension, which suggest that BEM induces beneficial changes in
physical/mental health of the patients. Since type 2 diabetes and
hypertension are chronic, slowly progressing and systemic
diseases, patients need to take care of their body for long term
to prevent complications. In this aspect, noninvasive and
nonpharmacologic methods such as BEM are very useful for a
long-term complementary care of hypertension/type 2 diabetes.
