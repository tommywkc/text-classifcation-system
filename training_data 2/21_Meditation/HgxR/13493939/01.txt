  balanced perspective of meditation as a practice that may lead to both

 Summations
    • Meditation practices are associated with the report of adverse events, particularly anxiety and depres-
       sion.
    • The  overall prevalence of meditation adverse events (8.3%) is similar to those reported for psy-
       chotherapy practice in general.

 Considerations
    • There is no standard assessment of adverse events in the reviewed literature, and randomized con-
       trolled trials are likely to under-report them.
    • Future research should focus on how meditation outcomes are aﬀected by context and individual dif-
       ferences, including appraisals of meditation experiences.
