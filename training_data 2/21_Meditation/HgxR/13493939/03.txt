                                   Increasing neuroimaging evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation expertise is related to
                                   different functional and structural configurations of the default mode network (DMN), the salience
                                   network (SN) and the executive network at rest. However, longitudinal studies observing resting
                                   network plasticity effects in brains of novices who started to practice meditation are scarce and
                                   generally related to one dimension, such as structural or functional effects. The purpose of this
                                   study was to investigate structural and functional brain network changes (e.g. DMN) after 40 days
                                   of mindfulness meditation training in novices and set these in the context of potentially altered
                                   depression symptomatology and anxiety. We found overlapping structural and functional effects in
                                   precuneus, a posterior DMN region, where cortical thickness increased and low-frequency amplitudes
                                   (ALFF) decreased, while decreased ALFF in left precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex correlates with the
                                   reduction of (CES-D) depression scores. In conclusion, regional overlapping of structural and functional
                                   changes in precuneus may capture different components of the complex changes of mindfulness
                                   meditation training.


                                   Mindfulness meditation has gained growing interest in psychological research. Mindfulness is defined as the
                                   process by which one attends to present-moment experiences non-judgementally, which can, for example, be
                                   developed through meditation practice1–3. Brain research has yielded global and local levels of differences in brain
                                   activity and connectivity related to meditation affecting several brain regions involving the default mode network
                                   (DMN), the salience network and the executive network. It is noteworthy that global changes have shown reduced
                                   connectivity between the nodes of the DMN and other networks, as well as reduced local activity and connec-
                                   tivity of nodes within these networks (e.g., ReHo, ALFF, nodal strength). This study aims to explore whether
                                   behavioural, structural and local functional brain changes are associated with short-term mindfulness meditation
                                   training.
                                       Mindfulness meditation practice primarily leads to reductions in ruminative thinking, even after controlling
                                   for decrements in affective symptoms and dysfunctional beliefs4. In patients with affective disorders, mindful-
                                   ness meditation intervention has been shown to improve anxiety and mood symptoms5. At a behavioural level,
                                   several studies have indicated that mindfulness-based therapy is a promising approach for treating anxiety and
                                   mood disorders6–8. Several previous studies have demonstrated the practice of mindfulness meditation leads to

                           brain changes at either structural or functional levels9–15. To track functional changes, resting-state functional
                           magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been proposed to analyse differential spontaneous modulations in the
                           blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal during resting conditions16. With rs-fMRI, researchers can char-
                           acterise the brain’s spontaneous functional activities in terms of both brain network connectivity and local fea-
                           tures, e.g. the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) to characterise the amplitude of local spontaneous
                           brain activity17. In contrast to the functional connectivity method, which measures the temporal synchronisation
                           between brain areas, the ALFF method helps to localise the brain functional alterations18. The quantitative meas-
                           urement of low-frequency oscillations, such as ALFF, provides promising tools to observe spontaneous BOLD
                           signal alterations in regional activity. As such, it may offer insight into the direct local consequences of the pre-
                           viously reported structural changes. Although several previous studies have associated brain structure changes
                           with mindfulness meditation training, plus there is evidence for a cross-sectional convergence of functional and
                           structural changes when comparing professional meditators and novices19, longitudinal research into structural
                           changes and their direct relationship would be necessary to more directly relate the changes in the two dimen-
                           sions to one another and to clinical or behavioural effects, respectively.
                               To study brain morphometry, several methods have been proposed to investigate brain structural changes,
                           such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM)20 and the cortical thickness measure (Freesurfer)21,22. The cortical
                           thickness measure is preferred because it utilises brain geometry to conduct inter-subject registration, which
                           contributes to a finer matching of homologous cortical locations than volumetric-based methods. Freesurfer is
                           commonly applied in many cortical thickness studies13,14,23, and in this study, Freesurfer is used for the cortical
                           thickness analysis given its advantages over the volume-based morphometry method. Fox et al. reported and
                           meta-analysed 123 brain structural differences using several morphometric measures (e.g. cortical thickness, grey
                           matter volume and concentration, fractional anisotropy, etc.) to show that mindfulness meditation also leads to
                           significant brain structure changes24. Prior studies have pioneered longitudinal analysis on grey and white matter
                           changes25–27. Tang et al. observed increased fractional anisotropy in the corona radiata connecting the cingulate
                           cortex after an 11-hour integrative body-mind training (IBMT)27. Santarnecchi et al. showed a significant increase
                           in cortical thickness in the right insula and the somatosensory cortex after an 8-weeks Mindfulness-Based Stress
                           Reduction (MBSR) training program25. Pickut et al. reported increased grey matter density in the bilateral cau-
                           date, left cuneus, left thalamus, and left lingual gyrus in an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention randomised
                           controlled trial (RCT) for Parkinson subjects who underwent mindfulness-based intervention26.
                               In cross-sectional studies, Kang et al. found increased cortical thickness in the superior frontal cortex, frontal
                           medial prefrontal cortex, temporal areas for meditation subjects compared to the controls13. Finally, it has been
                           demonstrated that the long-term practice of Sahaja Yoga Meditation leads to increased grey matter volume and
                           regional enlargement in different cortical and subcortical brain areas which are correlated with compassion and
                           interoceptive perception, sustained attention and self-control28. The recent work by Engen et al. investigated
                           structural brain networks changes of long-term mental training effects on socio-affective skills19. These authors
                           conducted both functional and structural analyses and found that ALFF increases in several prefrontal and insu-
                           lar areas during meditation relative to resting, and they also observed cortical changes.
                               In this longitudinal study, we investigated cortical thickness changes at the whole-brain level as well as ALFF
                           changes at the baseline and following 40-day short-term mindfulness meditation training. The primary objective
                           of this study was to investigate regionally overlapping longitudinal structural and functional (ALFF) changes
                           associated with short-term mindfulness meditation training in meditation novices. We hypothesised that the
                           repeated activation of brain regions corresponding to the brain networks recruited during meditation training
                           might induce congruent early structural and functional activity changes within relevant circuits. Based on prior
                           findings, these were hypothesised to concern the default mode network (DMN). We further hypothesised if these
                           brain changes were associated with potential behavioural changes in depression and anxiety scores. The current
                           study used the data collected in our previous work15.

                               On a whole brain level, changes in STAI trait scores were negatively correlated with the percentage thickness
                           changes in the left inferior temporal gyrus (Monte Carlo-corrected, p < 0.05, Fig. 3). For ALFF, there was no
                           whole-brain corrected correlation of the meditation-induced changes and changes in behavioural scores.
                               Given the regional effects on PCC/precuneus, we extracted the delta mean ALFF values at the left PCC/precu-
                           neus and correlated these with the delta CES-D and delta STAI-trait scores, respectively. We observed a negative
                           correlation with delta CES-D: p = 0.024, r = 0.619 (Fig. 2b). Likewise, no significant correlations with these var-
                           iables were observed at the baseline ALFF. When extracting cortical thickness in precuneus, no correlation with
                           either score was found.

                           Discussion
                           In the present longitudinal study, we investigated both the structural and ALFF changes following 40-day
                           short-term mindfulness meditation training and their relationship with the mood effects of the practice. The
                           results centred on the parietal cortex with a relative increase in cortical thickness in the left precuneus, which
                           significantly showed decreased ALFF. Furthermore, these decreases were stronger for those subjects who also
                           showed the most reductions in depression symptoms. Additional findings concerned the upper left parietal cortex
                           and bilateral IPL, where the cortical thickness increase in the left inferior temporal gyrus correlated with STAI
                           reductions after 40 days.
                               Our findings of structural changes following the meditation training period confirmed our hypothesis about
                           directionality based on previous results. In our study, greater thickness was observed in the left superior parietal
                           cortex and left precuneus. A previous study demonstrated increased cortical thickness, but focuses on multiple
                           prefrontal areas and insula regions19. In that study, however, the authors reported a cross-sectional increase with
                           a long-term meditators cohort relative to meditation-naïve controls. In other cross-sectional studies, once again
                           greater cortical thickness has been observed at the prefrontal cortex14,29 and in insula regions14 for the meditation
                           group compared to the matched controls. The focus of the effects on the parietal cortex, as found in our study,

                           has to be considered in contrast to other studies. In principle, one may assume two major potential sources of this
                           difference, one related to the investigated modalities and another to the varying experimental conditions. Most of
                           the studies performed to date have used grey matter volumetric analyses which, in contrast to our cortical thick-
                           ness measures, may have biased the findings; e.g. towards subcortical areas. However, thickness changes have also
                           been reported that have also focused on prefrontal or insula areas. Particularly the study by Santarnecchi et al.
                           also applied MBSR training over 8 weeks, so the differences would have been considered minimal. Nevertheless
                           in their study, no significant effects were found in the precuneus, but strong effects were noted in the insula and
                           somatosensory cortices instead25. Furthermore, rather than using surface-based methods, those authors used
                           voxel-based cortical thickness measures25. While the sources of varying structural changes in comparison to
                           previous studies cannot be entirely identified, the current structural findings seem, however, plausible given their
                           spatial overlap with accompanying functional changes.
                               Our previous study showed functional brain changes by employing resting-state functional connectivity
                           (RSFC) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures after short-term mindfulness meditation training15. Rs-fMRI
                           has been extensively used in recent years for investigating the neural correlates associated with mindfulness med-
                           itation training12,15,30–33. By employing ALFF measures in the present study, we found the decreased intensity of
                           low-frequency oscillations in regions of the DMN (PCC/precuneus and bilateral IPL) after mindfulness training.
                           Differential ALFF results have been observed in major depressive disorders (MDD) patients34–36. Increased ALFF
                           in IPL has been found in MDD patients compared to healthy controls36. It is noteworthy that an rs-fMRI study by
                           Sheline et al. has reported hyper-connectivity in the DMN for MDD subjects37.
                               Other than in structural studies, the functional activity and connectivity of precuneus and superior parietal
                           cortices are more frequently reported in meditation studies. The superior parietal cortex is related to attentional
                           function developed during the practice of mindfulness meditation30. In the precuneus, self-referential processing
                           is associated with increased functional activity38, which decreases during mindful self-awareness39. Likewise,
                           an altered RSFC of the superior parietal and precuneus has been observed in several previous meditation stud-
                           ies15,40,41. Superior parietal changes overlap with previously reported cortical thickness changes in Zen medi-
                           tators42. Furthermore, these findings extend our prior work based on the same subjects, in which we showed
                           that FC during meditation practice increased in the precuneus when compared to the baseline RSFC15. In a
                           meta-analysis on the structural effects of meditation, the precuneus emerged as a region of structural heteroge-
                           neities in meditation practitioners24. Fox et al. suggested that the structural connectivity between the precuneus
                           and areas of the attentional network, e.g. the superior parietal lobe, may be mediated by changes in the structural
                           white matter at the superior longitudinal fasciculus after brief meditation training. Therefore, increments in cor-
                           tical thickness in the superior parietal and precuneus after short-term meditation training may be caused by other
                           structural changes in white matter connectivity as well as FC during the mindfulness state as a practice effect after
                           brief mindfulness meditation.
                               Structural and functional changes were accompanied by reductions in depression scores and anxiety traits. To
                           reveal an indication of the interrelation of behavioural and brain effects of meditation, we correlated the signifi-
                           cant changes in the behavioural scores from the questionnaires (CES-D, STAI-trait) with brain changes in both
                           dimensions. The precuneus was revealed in both structural and functional findings, and the PCC/precuneus also
                           showed decreased ALFF, which correlated directly with the CES-D reductions. The relation between precuneus
                           resting state behaviour and depression symptoms has been demonstrated in many studies, mostly in depressed
                           cohorts43,44. Here we show that the PCC/precuneus, in its intrinsic fluctuation amplitudes, is also related to vary-
                           ing subclinical expressions of depressive symptomatology and their modulation by mindfulness meditation train-
                           ing, which has per se been demonstrated to act on depressive symptoms45. Interestingly, while we did also observe
                           structural changes in the precuneus, they did not correlate with the amount of CES-D reductions. Furthermore,
                           no other region correlated with this effect at the whole brain level, which places the co-occurrence of the struc-
                           tural and functional findings in a more complex picture. One could interpret the divergence of correlations as
                           being indicative of stronger, more sensitive effects in the functional domain. However, it is necessary to note that
                           for the other behavioural effect, namely reduced anxiety, we found correlation with the thickness increases in the
                           inferior temporal gyrus.
                               Taken together, the longitudinal changes seemed to show a regional overlap in the precuneus, which in itself
                           may indicate true neuronal effects observed across modalities, while their interindividual covariations with the
                           behaviour consequences of mindfulness meditation training support the notion of a brain-wide network affected
                           by the multitude of functional effects. Investigating this divergence and identifying the potential driving mech-
                           anisms may explain why effects on STAI reductions were found at different locations and in a distinct modality
                           from that for the functional changes associated with CES-D. It will be necessary to perform an analysis in a larger
                           new cohort with a control group that allows the inclusion of potential mediating variables and the control of other
                           relevant factors, as well as potentially varying signal-to-noise ratios for our observed effects.
                               Along these lines, it should be noted that the findings in this study also need to be considered in their respec-
                           tive limitations. The small sample size (n = 14) limits the generalizability of current findings. Another limitation
                           is that we did not recruit a control group and, therefore, these results have to be interpreted with caution. Future
                           longitudinal RCT studies in mindfulness meditation would be of interest. Our study showed longitudinal changes
                           in a single sample of meditation trainees across imaging modalities, which is its main contribution compared to
                           cross-sectional studies with a control group. To establish exact effect sizes and to support generalisability, our
                           study would have to be replicated in a larger sample, including a control condition. In this study we applied scrub-
                           bing as the head motion regressor in functional data preprocessing, and we also performed analyses without using
                           scrubbing, which is provided in the Supplementary Materials (see the Supplementary Materials). Furthermore,
                           the pre- and post- head motion parameters are also provided (see the Supplementary Materials).
                               In summary, we found that 40 days mindfulness meditation practice leads to a reduction of subclinical depres-

                           which cortical increase following meditation has been observed in the same sample. This mechanism falls well in
                           line with previous investigations on ALFF in depression and mindfulness meditation but needs to be placed in a
                           more complex picture of a network-wide effect with additional structural changes in temporal regions in associa-
                           tion with anxiety. Therefore, we conclude that functional and structural effects, despite regional overlapping, may
                           capture different components of the complex action of mindfulness meditation training.

                           Materials and Methods
                           The current analysis focuses on the structural and functional dataset which the functional data have been previ-
                           ously investigated for resting-state functional connectivity15. As such the reported parameters on subject inter-
                           vention and data acquisition are identical, while the analysis differs in terms of the analysed modalities and
                           respective phenomena.

                           Subjects. Fourteen university students (native Spanish speakers) were enrolled to be involved in a 40-day
                           mindfulness meditation training course. All the experiment protocols were approved by the local Ethics
                           Committee of the Institutional Review Board of the Universitat Jaume I of Castellon (Spain). Informed consent
                           was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The guidelines of the local Ethics Committee on research
                           involving human participants were collected from all the participants prior to inclusion. All the subjects were
                           screened by psychologists for the absence of any neurological or psychiatric disorder before being enrolled.
                           Subjects reported no previous participation in meditation courses or training. All the participants except one had
                           been reported in our previous study15, who was excluded due to excessive head movement during MR acquisition.

                           Mindfulness meditation training. As described in our previous work15, the mindfulness meditation pro-
                           gramme was structured as an 8-week training programme consisting of 45 minutes of daily home practice. The
                           self-observation-based mindfulness meditation training programme was designed using the MBSR programme1,
                           as well as acceptance and commitment therapy46. Training consisted of a 1.5-hour weekly session over an 8-week
                           period. During the first hour of the session, the subjects had to perform simple physical and breathing exercises,
                           during which Vipassana meditation was practiced by focusing their attention on thoughts without dwelling on
                           them. Afterwards, the participants had to remain silent and witness their thoughts without centring on them.
                           During the next sessions, the time allotted to meditation training was gradually increased without physical exer-
                           cises. During the remaining half hour of the session, the participants were requested to share their experiences
                           and were shown short videos that explained the most significant aspects of meditation and self-observation train-
                           ing. They were also encouraged to continue their daily meditation practice at home. The course instructor gave a

                           Behavioural measurements. Three self-assessment questionnaires were given to subjects at time points
                           TP1 and TP2. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which is a 20-item inventory47
                           was used to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms. The participants were requested to rate statements based on
                           the previous week on a 4-point Likert scale (0–3) that scored from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate higher levels of
                           depression. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was also applied, which is a 40-item scale measuring state and trait
                           anxiety based on a 4-point Likert scale (1–4). Scores range from 20 to 80, and high scores relate to high levels of
                           anxiety48. This portion of behavioural measurement is from part of our previous work15.
                              To explore the dimensions of potential effects on mindfulness, we further accessed the mindfulness meas-
                           ure Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) before and after the meditation training49. Specifically, we
                           assessed the facets of non-reactivity to inner experience, observation, acting with awareness, describing and
                           non-judgement of experience. The participants responded on a 9-point Likert-type scale (1 = never or rarely,
                           9 = almost always or always true) both before (TP1) and after (TP2) meditation training. Higher scores indicates
                           better mindfulness skills. We also used the Profile of Mood States (POMS), specifically the abbreviated Spanish
                           version50 of the original POMS51. It is a 44-item inventory that measures current mood state by rating state-
                           ments on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely) and consists of six subscales: anger, fatigue, tension,
                           depression, vigour and friendliness.

                           MR sequence parameters.            The MR measurements were performed on a 1.5 T Siemens AVANTO scan-
                           ner (Siemens Erlangen, Germany). The current study used previous data15. Structural images were acquired
                           with a magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 3.79 ms, flip
                           angle (FA) = 15°, 160 slices, matrix size = 256 × 256, field-of-view (FOV) = 256 mm × 256 mm, and slice thick-
                           ness = 1 mm). For resting-state fMRI acquisition, a standard EPI sequence was used (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 55 ms,
                           FA = 90°, FOV = 224 mm × 224 mm, matrix size = 64 × 64, and slice thickness = 4 mm) with 25 axial slices for
                           whole brain coverage. Finally, an extra gradient field mapping sequence (GRE field mapping) was acquired, fol-
                           lowed by another EPI sequence (TR = 487 ms, TE1 = 8 ms, TE2 = 12.76 ms, FA = 65°, FOV = 224 mm × 224 mm,
                           matrix size = 64 × 64, and slice thickness = 4 mm) with 25 slices with the same coverage used in the first EPI
                           sequence. GRE field mapping sequence was acquired to correct for field-inhomogeneity artefacts in EPI.

                           Structural data pre-processing pipeline.                Cortical thickness was calculated using FreeSurfer (http://
                           surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), version 5.3. T1 MPRAGE images were utilised in FreeSurfer to compute a
                           3-dimensional model of cortical surface reconstructions. The technical details of the processing procedure are
                           described in previous publications21,22,52–54.

                           calculate the boundary between grey/white matter and the pial surface. GM/WM/CSF segmentation quality was
                           visually examined in each subject, and the subjects with inaccurate segmentation were then excluded. Each hem-
                           isphere was parcellated automatically into 74 distinct cortical areas, and the thickness and volume of these brain
                           regions were calculated57.

                           Longitudinal structural data processing: cortical thickness – longitudinal two-stage model. Vertex-wise analyses
                           of cortical thickness changes were performed with Freesurfer. Firstly, each subject’s image data were smoothed
                           by using a Gaussian kernel with an FWHM of 15 mm. To investigate the changes in cortical thickness associated
                           with mindfulness meditation training, the longitudinalTwoStageModel implemented in FreeSurfer was executed
                           (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/LongitudinalTwoStageModel59). The first stage reduces the temporal
                           data within each subject to a single statistic (percent change). The second stage correlates it with a behavioural
                           covariate59 (see the Post hoc Correlation Analysis).
                               An inverse consistent registration was utilised to generate an unbiased within-subject template and images58,60.
                           The reliability and statistical power are significantly increased by using the common information from the
                           within-subject template to initialise the processing steps (skull stripping, Talairach transforms, atlas registration,
                           spherical surface maps and parcellations)59.
                               The quality assurance toolbox (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools) in FreeSurfer was used
                           to test the quality of the surface reconstruction and segmentation. In order to calculate the cortical thickness
                           changes after mindfulness training, the percent change (pc1) was used to obtain a cortical measure. PC1 is the
                           rate of change ((thickness2 - thickness1)/(time2 - time1), unit: mm/year) in relation to the thickness at the first
                           time point:
                                                                  (Thickness at TP 2 − Thickness at TP 1)
                                                                                TP 2 − TP 1                           mm

                           Rs-fMRI data preprocessing. B0 inhomogeneity correction was performed to reduce static field inhomo-
                           geneity using an FSL EpiUnwarping tool (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/epidewarp.fsl)61. The similar
                           rs-fmri data preprocessing procedure was carried out as in our previous publication15. The first 10 images for each
                           subject were discarded to allow for steady-state longitudinal magnetisation. The remaining images were then
                           preprocessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and Data Processing
                           Assistant for the resting state fMRI (DPARSF Version 4.362). Functional images were slice-time corrected. Motion
                           correction was performed by using a least squares approach and a six-parameter (rigid body) linear transforma-
                           tion. One subject was excluded according to the criterion that head motion was restricted to less than 2 mm of
                           displacement or 2 degrees of rotation in any direction. The frame-wise displacement value (FD_Power) showed
                           no significant difference between the time points (t = 1.488, p=0.162; see Supplementary Table 1). Spatial nor-
                           malisation to MNI space was carried out by using the unified segmentation of the T1-weighted acquired images.
                           The extracted normalisation parameters from segmentation were applied to normalise the functional volumes
                           for each participant (normalised images were then resampled to 3 mm isotropic voxels). Nuisance variables were
                           regressed out (head motion parameters, white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal). Scrubbing with regres-
                           sion strategy was used to reduce the motion effect from the subjects63. The linear trends of the BOLD signals were
                           regressed.

                           ALFF analysis. We calculated ALFF by using DPARSF v 4.3. The time series for each voxel was first band-pass
                           filtered (0.01–0.1 Hz) and then fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) to acquire a power spectrum in the frequency
                           domain. The square root of the power spectrum was obtained and averaged across a frequency of 0.01–0.1 Hz
                           at each voxel. The averaged square root was then known as ALFF. Furthermore, the ALFF of each voxel for each
                           participant was divided by the global mean ALFF for standardisation17. Finally, the whole-brain-mean scaled
                           ALFF maps were smoothed by applying a 6-mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel prior to
                           the statistical analysis.

                           Statistical analysis. Behavioural data analysis. Changes in the Depression (CES-D) and Anxiety scores
                           (STAI-state and STAI-trait) were assessed by paired-t tests with significance accepted for Bonferroni corrected at
                           p < 0.05 for three tests, based on prior publications on antidepressant effects45. To further explore the dimensions
                           of behavioural effects, the mindfulness questionnaires (FFMQ) and Profiles of Mood States (POMS) question-
                           naires were assessed for any relevant changes in the respective subscales with no prior hypothesis on an individual
                           item. The results are considered significant for an uncorrected p < 0.05 at an exploratory level.

                           Structural data analysis. One-sample t-tests were performed by using the percent thickness change as the point
                           measure. To correct for multiple comparisons, the Monte-Carlo simulation (mc-z; synthesised, smoothed z-field)
                           within FreeSurfer was used to correct for multiple comparisons. The results were then smoothed by the residual
                           and repeated for 10000 iterations with a threshold of p < 0.05 (two-tailed).

                           ALFF analysis. A voxel-wise ALFF analysis was performed to assess the whole brain amplitude of low-frequency
                           fluctuation changes in mindfulness meditation training. A paired t-test was performed to test the whole brain lon-
                           gitudinal ALFF differences (two-tailed). Multiple comparisons were corrected at an FDR cluster level of p < 0.05
                           with a conservative initial voxel height threshold of p < 0.001.

                           Post hoc correlation analysis. Regression models (one-sample t-tests) included the percent thickness change
                           as an independent factor and the above behavioural scores changes as dependent factors. Age and gender were
                           included as nuisance covariates in all the GLM analyses. Respective multiple comparisons correction was carried
                           out to correct type I errors.
                               A post hoc Pearson correlation analysis was also calculated to investigate the relationship between the ALFF
                           values and behavioural scores (a statistical significance level of p < 0.05 was used). The analysis was done only on
                           those items from the questionnaires that revealed a significant main effect of intervention. Based on our behav-
                           ioural results in this study, the cortical thickness and ALFF changes were correlated with the significant changes
                           in behavioural scores from questionnaires CES-D and STAI-trait.
