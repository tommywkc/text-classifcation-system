Keywords:
Meditation training can improve mood and emotion regulation, yet the neural mechanisms of these affective Emotion regulation
changes have yet to be fully elucidated. We evaluated the impact of long- and short-term mindfulness meditation Mindfulness

had 9081 h of lifetime practice on average, primarily in mindfulness meditation. Short-term training consisted of Connectivity
an 8-week Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction course (N ¼ 32, 22 female), which was compared to an active Prefrontal cortex
control condition (N ¼ 35, 19 female) in a randomized controlled trial. Meditation training was associated with less amygdala reactivity to positive pictures relative to controls, but there were no group differences in response to negative pictures. Reductions in reactivity to negative stimuli may require more practice experience or concen-trated practice, as hours of retreat practice in long-term meditators was associated with lower amygdala reactivity to negative pictures – yet we did not see this relationship for practice time with MBSR. Short-term training, compared to the control intervention, also led to increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and a region implicated in emotion regulation – ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) – during affective pictures.

Thus, meditation training may improve affective responding through reduced amygdala reactivity, and height-ened amygdala–VMPFC connectivity during affective stimuli may reflect a potential mechanism by which MBSR
exerts salutary effects on emotion regulation ability.

Fig. 1. Long-term meditation training is associated with lower right amygdala reactivity to emotional pictures. Long-term meditators (LTM) had lower right amygdala activation for the negative versus neutral pictures at a trend level (a), and significantly lower activation for positive versus neutral pictures than mediation-naïve participants (MNP; b). Greater lifetime hours of open monitoring (OM) retreat practice predicted lower right amygdala activation for negative versus neutral pictures, controlling for age (c). The independently defined right amygdala region of interest from which mean percent signal change data were extracted is inset in each panel.

Circles represent raw data points in a and b, and the raw data are adjusted for age in c. Error bars and envelopes are 95% confidence intervals around the point estimates.
