 Volumetry                        Measures the volume (mm3 ) of a particular predeﬁned ROI (e.g.,               Larger volumetric measure → larger structure size
                                  amygdala)
 Concentration                    Estimates the concentration of gray or white matter throughout                Greater concentration → greater density of tissue type
                                  the brain on a voxel-by-voxel basis, or in voxels within a                    within voxel or ROI
                                  predeﬁned ROI
 Thickness                        Estimates the thickness (mm) of either cortex or other structures             Greater thickness → greater number of neurons/glia or
                                  (e.g., corpus callosum)                                                       ﬁbers in a given region
 Fractional Anisotropy            Estimates how ‘cigar-shaped’ (anisotropic) white matter ﬁber                  Greater FA → greater white matter ﬁber density and/or
                                  tracts are at a given voxel                                                   coherence
 Diffusivity                      Estimates the coherence of water diffusion either parallel (axial             Lower axial and radial diffusivity → greater axonal integrity
                                  diffusivity) or perpendicular (radial diffusivity) to axons                   and myelination, respectively
 Gyriﬁcation                      Estimates the degree of folding of cortical surface on a                      Higher index of gyriﬁcation → greater cortical surface area
                                  point-by-point basis                                                          (mm2 ) per unit volume (mm3 )

however, lower axial diffusivity as measured with DTI is interpreted
as structural enhancement of white matter (see Table 1). Therefore,
following this interpretation, higher axial diffusivity in controls
vs. meditators suggests white matter increases in meditation
practitioners. Accordingly, only Fayed et al. (2013) and Kang et al.
(2013) actually report results of controls > meditators, and only
one such result is reported by Fayed et al. (2013). Of 10 such results
reported by Kang et al. (2013), half (5) were signiﬁcant at stringent
statistical thresholds. Brain regions showing structure differences
of controls > meditators included somatomotor cortices, anterior
and posterior cingulate cortices, temporoparietal junction, middle
temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and cuneus (for detailed
information, see results indicated with an asterisk [*] in Table S1).

study sample size, was medium-to-large by Cohen’s (1992) criteria
                                                                                   is likely due to the very large sample size employed in this test.
(d̄global = 0.77 ± 0.11; r̄global = .34). One extreme, unduly inﬂuen-

Fayed et al., 2013) was excluded from the averages.                                3.9. Mean effect size as a function of meditation experience
    We reiterate, however, that effect sizes are based on peak dif-

(0.34/0.60 = ∼56.67%). Cluster mean effect sizes, then, are clearly
the more conservative estimates. Assuming a similar cluster–peak
effect size differential for other morphometric neuroimaging stud-
ies, we recalculated more conservative (‘adjusted’) mean effect
sizes at ∼57% of each study’s raw mean effect size (Table 2). This
yields d̄global adjusted = 0.44 ± 0.04, and r̄global adjusted = .19. With
these conservative adjustments, effect sizes for morphometric neu-
roimaging in meditators fall between the ‘small’ and ‘medium’
effect size level (r = .1–.3; Cohen, 1992).


3.8. Mean effect sizes by tissue type (gray vs. white matter)

    To examine whether meditation is differentially associated with
greater morphology differences in given brain tissue types, we
also compared mean effect sizes for studies examining gray matter
(d̄gray = 0.81 ± 0.15; r̄gray = .35) vs. white matter (d̄white = 0.73 ±
0.02; r̄white = .34) results separately (Fig. 3). One study (Kang
et al., 2013) was not included in this analysis because results for
both tissue types were mixed in their results. Levene’s test for
heterogeneity of variance was signiﬁcant, F(679) = 71.56, p < .001.
Therefore, not assuming equal variances, we found a signiﬁcant
difference between mean effect sizes for the two tissue types,
t(557) = 2.84, p = .005, suggesting that meditation may affect gray
matter more strongly than white matter (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, in
                                                                                   Fig. 4. Mean study effect size as a function of meditation experience. Linear corre-
