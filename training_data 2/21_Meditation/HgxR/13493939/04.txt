Pain is a multidimensional experience that involves interacting sensory, cognitive, and affective factors, rendering
the treatment of chronic pain challenging and financially burdensome. Further, the widespread use of opioids to
treat chronic pain has led to an opioid epidemic characterized by exponential growth in opioid misuse and addiction.
The staggering statistics related to opioid use highlight the importance of developing, testing, and validating fast-
acting nonpharmacological approaches to treat pain. Mindfulness meditation is a technique that has been found
to significantly reduce pain in experimental and clinical settings. The present review delineates findings from
recent studies demonstrating that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates pain through multiple, unique
mechanisms—an important consideration for the millions of chronic pain patients seeking narcotic-free, self-
facilitated pain therapy.

Mindfulness meditation and sham mindfulness meditation produced activation (red) in the bilateral putamen and primary
somatosensory cortex (SI) corresponding to the nose/face regions and deactivation (blue) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
and precuneous/poster cingulate cortex (PCC). Mindfulness meditation also activated the right inferior frontal gyrus and produced
