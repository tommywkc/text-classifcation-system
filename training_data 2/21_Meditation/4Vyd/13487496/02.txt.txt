Keywords:                                     The unprecedented global health concerns pertaining to COVID-19 have impacted the hotel industry. In order to 
COVID-19                                      ameliorate such concerns, hotels are sending out marketing communication messages. However, whether the 
Consumer behavior                             messages effectively impact hotel consumers’ behaviors is still unknown. To fill this research gap, this study

                                              COVID-19 related messages. The results also indicated that PSC had a negative influence on booking intentions 
                                              for the low loyalty group, and brand loyalty still played a key role even amidst the COVID-19 crisis.
