                                              behaviours among different personality profile groups. Third, the study further conducts a follow-up survey on

                                              employed to validate the findings. The findings reveal that personality profiles lead to varying effects of all 
                                              critical factors in influencing the energy-saving behaviours of hotel guests. The research empirically demon­

                                              guests and provides a novel view of understanding the heterogeneity of energy-saving behaviours in the hos­

                                              habit factors. Also, the study classifies the respondents into groups according to personality characteristics and 
                                              demonstrates the significant role of personality. The research applies a follow-up study that can provide factual 
                                              evidence to support the result of previous hypothetical testing. The findings provide valuable references to the 
                                              development of tailored smart energy intervention measurements and management tools for hotel buildings.
