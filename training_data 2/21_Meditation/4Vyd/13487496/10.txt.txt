  Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures were shown to impact
  negatively on people’s mental health. In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk
  than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a
  key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female
  teachers (n = 66, age: 51.5 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before
                          ±
  and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality
  proﬁles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels
  were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM)
  course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality
  proﬁles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR, n = 32) and a high-resilience
  (HR, n = 26) group. The LR and HR groups diﬀered at baseline in most of the self-report measures.
  Pre–post MOM signiﬁcant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, aﬀective
  empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits
  and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher
  in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can eﬀectively mitigate
  the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore
  well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.

1. Introduction
     The Italian population has recently experienced the ﬁrst nationwide lockdown of the 21st century
due to the Covid-19 infectious disease. After the Covid-19 outbreak in China in December 2019,
the epidemic moved to the European region and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March
2020 [1], when Italy was the worst aﬀected country outside China and was soon becoming the new
center of the virus spread. City and regional lockdowns in Italy had already started in February, but
the nationwide lockdown started on 9 March 2020, with an estimated 56 million people ordered to
remain at home: bars, restaurants, schools and churches were closed and only essential services were
permitted (e.g., vital health-care, food stores, electricity/gas/water/fuel suppliers, garbage collection).

At the release of the toughest lockdown measures, on 4 May 2020, Italy had oﬃcially experienced
210,717 Covid-19 cases and had suﬀered 28,884 deaths due to this disease [2].
     Besides the casualties and the economic loss (with a 9.1% estimated drop in GDP for 2020 [3])
                                                     −
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the fear of the virus and the 2-month lockdown had a serious
psychological impact on a large part of the Italian population. Early reports emerging in the literature
have shown that between 40% and 50% of adults have experienced psychological distress following the
Covid-19 outbreak [4,5], and that 30% of adults and children are at high risk for post-traumatic stress
symptoms [6]. These results are in line with those previously collected from Chinese samples [7–10],
and extend our previous knowledge of the psychological burden of quarantines coming from past
(shorter and smaller scale) experiences of isolation due to public health emergencies and relative
conﬁnement measures [11].
     Previous experiences with global health emergencies have shown that the eﬀective use of
lockdown as a public health approach requires minimizing the harmful eﬀects associated with it:
the fundamental steps to this purpose seem to be the ensuring of suﬃcient primary supplies during
the lockdown, and a clear communication, by the authorities, of the reasons for the restrictions and
of the protocols to be followed [11], as well as cash transfers and job retention acts [12]. Moreover,
other institutional and individual interventions have been proposed to protect mental heath in
vulnerable groups, in particular during emergency situations such as the Covid-19 outbreak. These
include stigma mitigation [13], psychological/psychiatric assistance [14,15], psychoeducation [16] and
teaching self-help methods [15,17].
     Teaching evidence-based self-help methods often represents a viable option to address the
urgent need of psychological support for large numbers of people, when in-person services are
suspended [18,19]. A recent review of the meta-analyses of self-guided interventions to alleviate anxiety,
depression and stress concluded that such interventions signiﬁcantly improve well-being in comparison
to control groups, albeit with eﬀect sizes smaller than those associated with traditional guided
individual or group therapies [20]. The interventions that proved to be the most eﬀective included
self-guided cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and Mindfulness-Based
Interventions (MBIs).
     Mindfulness-Based Interventions are generally based on meditation practices taken from
the Buddhist tradition and adapted into contemporary, psychologically-oriented programs [21].
These programs are usually delivered over 8 consecutive weeks, with eight group meetings led by a
mindfulness instructor and daily individual practice at home [22]. Several studies have highlighted
the beneﬁts of MBIs mainly in terms of self-reported reductions in anxiety, depression and stress
levels [23–25]. Other improvements due to MBIs have been reported for job burnout [26], interoceptive
awareness [27,28], empathy [29,30], character traits [31,32] and psychological well-being [33,34]. It is
important to underline that, after the completion of the program, participants can maintain and
enhance the beneﬁts gained during the training program by continuing with the meditation on their
own. Two decades since the introduction of MBIs, research has showed that they could be eﬀective
in promoting well-being also when delivered through a single introductory group meeting, during
which the meditation practices are taught and participants carry on the program individually [35,36],
or when delivered via the internet [37,38]. MBIs are therefore tools potentially suitable for dealing
with stressors arising during lockdown periods, because they can help manage psychological suﬀering
and they can be delivered even in situations where face-to-face meetings are suspended and a large
number of people need psychological support.
     In the present study, an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation course (MOM, which is a
standardized MBI) was delivered, through two face-to-face meetings (before these meetings were
prohibited by the government due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic) and six video-lessons, to a
sample of female teachers (Figure1). Although the MOM course was not originally aimed at mitigating
the psychological distress resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, as this event was unpredictable,
it ended up being addressed to a class of the general population most vulnerable to the consequences
    Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW                    4 of 22 

    designed to support teachers’ mental health (i.e., to prevent professional burnout and improve well-
    being [60]). After participant recruitment, two parallel MOM courses were scheduled and two schools 
    were chosen as the locations for the courses. Participants enrolled in one of the two courses based on 
    the location of the course (the locations of the courses were about 60 km away). The MOM courses 
    were held by two of the authors (A.M., a professional socio-health educator, and A.P., a psychologist), 
    who have more than five years of experience in practicing and teaching mindfulness meditation. 
        In the original design of the study, data collected from participants in the MOM training should 
    have been compared with data from control participants obtained after the end of the MOM course 
    (in two sessions, eight weeks apart—the same time that elapsed between the pre- and post-MOM 
    course assessments). However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy in the first weeks of the MOM 
    course, the control group of participants was not assessed; data from teachers attending the MOM 
    course who were assessed one month before and one month after the national lockdown could not 
    have been fairly compared to the data from teachers who were in a condition with fewer restrictions 
    thanks to the loosening of the lockdown. 
        The MOM training program started on Tuesday 11 February 2020. At the end of the second week 
    of the course, on Sunday 23 February, the regional government of Friuli Venezia-Giulia ordered the 
    closure of all schools and universities. The following six teachings were therefore delivered through 
    30-minute video lessons sent via the internet, and participants were asked to continue their MOM 
    practice on their own (see Figure 1). They could communicate with their MOM instructor through 
    emails, telephone messages and phone calls in case they wanted to share their meditation experiences 
    or to pose questions about the contents of the video lessons. 
        Participants were assessed in the days before the training program (Time T0, between 6 February

    proportion of teachers from different school levels (21 teachers from primary schools, 4 from

    secondary and 2 from preschools in the first course; 22 from primary, 5 from secondary and 4 from

personal experiences and education) measures taken at baseline with the Temperament and Character
Inventory [58,59].
     In our study, we therefore analyzed, within the full sample of female teachers receiving the MOM
course, the data of a group of teachers with a high-resilience (HR) proﬁle, and the data of a group of
teachers with a low-resilience (LR) proﬁle. These teachers were assessed with validated self-report
instruments one month before (when the Covid-19 outbreak in China did not seem to threaten the
Italian population) and one month after the imposition of the national lockdown in Italy (when the
population was shocked by the unprecedented measures taken by the Italian government to deal
with the spread of the Covid-19 infectious disease). In this period, the teachers received an 8-week
mindfulness meditation course—partly (25%) delivered in person and partly (75%) via the internet.
They were assessed in terms of their mindfulness skills, empathy, personality proﬁle, interoceptive
awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout level.
     Three main objectives were pursued in our study. Objective 1: to establish whether the two groups
of teachers, who had two opposite proﬁles of resilience at baseline (obtained from teachers’ personality
proﬁles before the MOM  course), were diﬀerent at baseline in the other measures employed in our
study as well. Based on previous research on resilience [44–57], we hypothesized that the low-resilience
group, compared to the high-resilience group, had worse baseline levels of psychological well-being,
mindfulness skills, interoceptive awareness, emotional distress, empathy and burnout (H1).
     Objective 2: to examine the changes in the two groups that occurred from before to after the
MOM    course; this also allows observation of the between-group diﬀerences after the intervention.
Based on the previous literature on the eﬀects of MBIs [23–34], which referred to periods free from
global health emergencies like that related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we hypothesized that both

groups of teachers experienced similar improvements in mindfulness skills, empathy, character traits
and interoceptive awareness (H2). As the psychological impact of compulsory isolation in the context
of a world-wide pandemic has not previously been examined in relation to mindfulness meditation
courses, the analyses of changes in the measures of psychological well-being, burnout and emotional
distress (anxiety and depression) were exploratory.
     Objective 3: to evaluate the teachers’ satisfaction with the MOM course and their perception of the
course’s impact on their lives in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak. Based on our many years of
experience in conducting MOM  courses (see Methods), we hypothesized a moderate to high course
satisfaction (H3a). Based on the perceived eﬀectiveness of mindfulness meditation as a self-help
method [20], we also hypothesized that participants could perceive mindfulness meditation as a useful
practice in living through the Covid-19 lockdown period (H3b).

2. Method

2.1. Procedure
     An 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) training program was organized by the
University of Udine on behalf of the Prevention Department and ﬁnanced by the Friuli Venezia-Giulia
region, in the northeast of Italy in a preventive medicine project. This project was originally designed
to support teachers’ mental health (i.e., to prevent professional burnout and improve well-being [60]).
After participant recruitment, two parallel MOM courses were scheduled and two schools were chosen
as the locations for the courses. Participants enrolled in one of the two courses based on the location of
the course (the locations of the courses were about 60 km away). The MOM courses were held by two
of the authors (A.M., a professional socio-health educator, and A.P., a psychologist), who have more
than ﬁve years of experience in practicing and teaching mindfulness meditation.
     In the original design of the study, data collected from participants in the MOM training should
have been compared with data from control participants obtained after the end of the MOM course (in
two sessions, eight weeks apart—the same time that elapsed between the pre- and post-MOM course
assessments). However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy in the ﬁrst weeks of the MOM course,
the control group of participants was not assessed; data from teachers attending the MOM course who
were assessed one month before and one month after the national lockdown could not have been fairly
compared to the data from teachers who were in a condition with fewer restrictions thanks to the
loosening of the lockdown.
     The MOM training program started on Tuesday 11 February 2020. At the end of the second week
of the course, on Sunday 23 February, the regional government of Friuli Venezia-Giulia ordered the
closure of all schools and universities. The following six teachings were therefore delivered through
30-minute video lessons sent via the internet, and participants were asked to continue their MOM
practice on their own (see Figure1). They could communicate with their MOM instructor through
emails, telephone messages and phone calls in case they wanted to share their meditation experiences
or to pose questions about the contents of the video lessons.
     Participants were assessed in the days before the training program (Time T0, between 6 February
2020 and 11 February 2020) and after the end of the program (Time T1, between 2 April 2020 and
15 April 2020). Data was obtained using paper-and-pencil questionnaires at T0 and using internet-based
questionnaires at T1. For T1, the teachers agreed to complete the survey entirely in one session (as
done at T0), paying close attention.

2.2. Participants
     In total, 67 school teachers (1M, 66F; all Caucasian) were recruited    through  oﬃcial
communications sent to primary and secondary State schools and preschools in the province of
Udine, Friuli Venezia-Giulia. The sample size was determined by the maximum number of participants
eligible for the two MOM courses. In the two MOM courses, there was an equal proportion of teachers
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                      5 of 22

from diﬀerent school levels (21 teachers from primary schools, 4 from secondary and 2 from preschools
in the ﬁrst course; 22 from primary, 5 from secondary and 4 from preschools in the second course).
     This study concerned the 66 female teachers (age: 51.5 7.9 years) participating in the MOM
                                                         ±
training program. The sample considered is representative of the Italian teachers, which are on average
older than in most other developed countries (average age of teachers in Italy—48.6 years; average for
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development—44.1 years) [61].
     Written informed consent was obtained from all participants during the ﬁrst assessment session.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Udine and all procedures
performed in the study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration
and its later amendments (ethical code: CGPER-2019-12-09-01). All data was processed anonymously
and data conﬁdentiality was ensured.

2.3. Mindfulness Oriented Meditation (MOM) Course
     The MOM    course is an 8-week training program, with a 2 h group meeting per week and
30 min daily meditation practice at home [31,32,36,60,62–64]. In its structure it is similar to an MBSR
course (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), the most common mindfulness meditation program
developed by Kabat-Zinn [65]. Each MOM  meeting is divided into three parts: a 15/30 min teaching
on topics related to meditative practice, a 30 min guided MOM practice and a ﬁnal phase during
which participants can share their experiences and ask questions to the instructor. These are the
topics covered in the teachings [64]: historical introduction to mindfulness meditation, what is
mindfulness meditation and how to practice it, facing pain with a mindful attitude, attention and
awareness, being in the here and now, disidentiﬁcation, deautomatization, and letting go. The MOM
practice, which is the same throughout the course, entails a 10 min session of paying attention to
one’s breathing (anapanasati meditation), 10 min dedicated to heeding one’s bodily sensations (body
scan meditation) and 10 min dedicated to being aware of one’s emotional and mental phenomena
(vipassana meditation). The main reference for these practices within the Buddhist context, from which
mindfulness meditation was adapted, is the Satipatthana¯ discourse [66], although the instructions given
to participants during the meditations do not refer to Buddhism. The same three practices are part of
other contemporary, secular and psychologically-oriented mindfulness meditation courses, such as
MBSR. After the ﬁrst meeting, participants are provided with a 30 min audio recording containing a
guided MOM practice (http://www.medita-mom.it/materiale), as an aid for home meditation practice.
Participants are provided with articles and book suggestions on the topics covered in the course based
on personal requests.
     The theoretical or practical parts of the MOM course delivered in this study were not tailored for
the speciﬁc group of teachers participating in the study during the Covid-19 outbreak: the teachings
remained adherent to the original version of the MOM course [64] and the meditation—guided by
instructors in the ﬁrst two meetings and to be performed at home by the participants throughout
the course—remained the same during the 8 weeks of the course. Discussions between participants
and instructors, which normally take place in the ﬁnal part of each MOM meeting, were replaced by
personal communications via mail, phone messages or calls in the last 6 MOM weeks (see Figure1),
after the government prohibited face-to-face meetings due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

2.4. Measures
     Demographic characteristics were obtained at T0. Participants reported their age, gender, level of
education, body height and body weight, previous experiences in meditation and if they were diagnosed
with any medical disease or psychiatric disorder.
     Home practice was assessed through diaries collected every two weeks. Teachers were asked to
record their daily practice of mindfulness meditation in the diaries.
     Mindfulness skills were assessed with the Italian version of the Five-Facet Mindfulness
Questionnaire (FFMQ [67,68]). This 39-item instrument measures ﬁve mindfulness scales: observing
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                      6 of 22

(OBS), describing (DES), acting with awareness (AWA), non-judging of inner experience (NJU),
and non-reactivity to inner experience (NRE). Respondents are asked to rate each statement using
a 5-level Likert scale (1 = never or very rarely true, 5 = very often or always true; item example:
“I watch my feelings without getting lost in them”). Higher scores in each scale reﬂect a greater level
of mindfulness. FFMQ has a high internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach’s α = 0.86) and
acceptable values for its ﬁve scales (α 0.74) [68] (see below the Results section for present sample
                                    ≥
Cronbach’s α).
     Empathy was assessed with the Italian translation of the Questionnaire of Aﬀective and Cognitive
Empathy (QCAE [69,70]). Using a 4-level Likert scale response format (1  =  strongly disagree,
4 = strongly agree), this 31-item instrument assesses the two main components of empathy, namely
aﬀective empathy (AE, a person’s emotional resonance to other people’s experiences; item example—“It
worries me when others are worrying and panicky”) and cognitive empathy (CE, the ability to
understand how other people feel; item example—“I always try to consider the other fellow’s feelings
before I do something”). QCAE has acceptable internal consistency for the AE and CE components,
and the total score (α 0.77) [70].
                    ≥
     The personality proﬁle was assessed with the Italian adaptation of the 125-item Temperament and
Character Inventory (TCI; [58,59,71]). This tool assesses the temperament and character dimensions of
personality using a dichotomous true-false response format (item example: “I’m often so determined
that I continue working long after other people give up”). Temperament scales include novelty-seeking
(NS, the propensity towards impulsivity, exploratory excitability and eccentricity), harm avoidance
(HA, the propensity to respond strongly to aversive stimuli), reward dependence (RD, the propensity
to respond intensely to signs of social gratiﬁcation) and persistence (P, the tendency to pursue goals
despite fatigue and frustration). Character scales include self-directedness (SD, the ability to recognize
the self as autonomous, and the feeling of self-conﬁdence, honor and hope), cooperativeness (C, the
ability to recognize the self as an organic part of society) and self-transcendence (ST, the ability to
recognize the self as an organic part of nature and its source). TCI in its 125-item version has acceptable
internal consistency for all scales (α 0.71) [71].
                                  ≥
     Interoceptive awareness was assessed with the Italian version of the Multidimensional Assessment
of Interoceptive Awareness scale (MAIA [72,73]). This 32-item instrument uses a 6-level Likert scale
response format (0 = never, 5 = always; item example—“I notice when I am uncomfortable in my body”).
MAIA measures interoceptive awareness through eight subscales: noticing (NOT, the awareness of
neutral, comfortable and uncomfortable body sensations), not-distracting (NDI, the propensity not to
distract oneself from sensations of discomfort or pain), not-worrying (NWO, the propensity not to
worry when sensations of discomfort or pain are experienced), attention regulation (ARE, the ability
to focus and sustain attention to body sensations), emotional awareness (EAW, the ability to connect
body sensations to underlying emotional states), self-regulation (SRE, the ability to manage distress
by listening to body sensations), body listening (BLI, the propensity to actively listen to the body for
information) and trusting (TRU, the tendency to trust your body). The Cronbach’s α values for internal
consistency varied between 0.53 and 0.80 in the eight MAIA scales [73].
     Psychological well-being was assessed with the Italian version of the 18-item Psychological
Well-being Scales (PWB [74,75]). This tool uses a 4-level Likert scale response format (1 = strongly
disagree, 4 = strongly agree; item example—“I like most parts of my personality”) and the six scales
included are self-acceptance (SA), autonomy (AU), environmental mastery (EM), personal growth
(PG), positive relations with others (PR) and purpose in life (PL). Higher scores on any scale indicate
greater indices of happiness and psychological well-being. PWB Scales showed Cronbach’s α values
ranging from 0.60 to 0.70 [76], which appears to be a suﬃcient level of internal consistency based on
the fact that each subscale comprised only three items.
     Emotional distress was assessed using the Italian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS [77,78]). This 14-item instrument uses a 4-level Likert scale response format, with
levels that diﬀer depending on the question. Although originally developed to measure anxiety

(item example: “Worrying thoughts go through my mind”) and depression (item example: “I look
forward with enjoyment to things”) in non-psychiatric clinical settings, the HADS has been extensively
employed as an eﬀective tool even in non-clinical populations [79]. It provides separate scores for
anxiety, depression and global emotional distress. In a review of the literature, HADS showed a
high internal consistency across studies for both anxiety (mean Cronbach’s α = 0.83) and depression
measures (mean Cronbach’s  α = 0.82) [80].
     Teacher burnout was assessed with the Italian translation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory
Educators Survey (MBI-ES [81,82]). Using a 7-level Likert scale response format (0 = never, 6 = always;
item example—“I feel frustrated by my job”), this 22-item instrument measures three components of
burnout in relation to teacher–student interaction: feelings of overwhelming emotional exhaustion
(EE), depersonalization and detachment from the job (DP), and a lack of personal or professional
accomplishment (PA). Burnout is indicated by high scores for EE and DP, and a low score for PA.
MBI-ES has acceptable internal consistency for each of its components (α 0.76) [82].
                                                                    ≥
     The evaluation of the MOM  course, also in relation to the Covid-19 outbreak, was obtained at
T1. This included six general questions prepared by the authors of the study about the MOM course,
and four questions related to the Covid-19 emergency (see Table1). Each question was rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale (for Q1–Q8, 1 = not at all, 5 = very much; for Q9–Q10, 1 = much worse,
5 = much better).

2.5. Statistical Analyses
     Before all analyses, missing values in participants’ responses were imputed using the mean score
of the whole sample for the corresponding item, since the total percentage of missing values was very
low (0.10%).
     Analyses of baseline data and pre- to post-course changes included a between-subject Group factor.
As past research has shown that the most inﬂuential TCI scales on self-reported resilience were harm
avoidance (HA, negatively correlated to resilience) and self-directedness (SD, positively correlated
to resilience) [54–56], participants were classiﬁed as having a low-resilience (LR) or high-resilience
(HR) proﬁle on the basis of their HA and SD scores obtained at baseline. Participants in the LR group
therefore had higher HA and lower SD scores than participants in the HR group. The clustering
procedure, which assigned each participant to one of the two groups, was performed on the participants’
standardized HA and SD scores (see Figure2) with the k-means algorithm [83].

were checked for each group of data (using a signiﬁcance threshold of 0.01 to avoid alpha-inﬂation).
Data transformation or robust tests were used in the case of violations of the normality assumption.
In the case of violations of the sphericity assumption, the degrees of freedom in the ANOVA were
corrected by applying the Greenhouse–Geisser procedure (indicated by [GG] in the results). All post-hoc
pairwise contrasts were performed using the Holm–Bonferroni procedure. As a measure of eﬀect size,
the Partial Eta-Squared (ηP2) was used. All eﬀects are reported as signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

3. Results
     Eight teachers could not complete the training, and this resulted in an 11.9% drop-out rate.
The ﬁnal sample consisted of 58 female teachers (age: 50.8 8.0 years).

3.1. Objective 1: Baseline Diﬀerences in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Proﬁles

Sample Partitioning Based on Resilience Proﬁle
     The k-means algorithm included 26 of the 58 participants who completed the MOM course in the
high-resilience (HR) proﬁle group and the remaining 32 participants in the low-resilience (LR) proﬁle
group (Figure2). The solution found was stable (i.e., the same classiﬁcation was invariably obtained
by repeating the clustering procedure). When comparing the resilience proﬁles of the 58 teachers who
completed the MOM    course with those of the 8 teachers who dropped out (HA: z = 0.20   0.58;
                                                                                 −     ±
SD: z = 0.25  0.40), it was observed that the HA and SD scores of the drop-outs mainly fell in between
            ±
those of the teachers in the HR group (HA: z = 0.26 0.82; SD: z = 0.64 0.51) and those of the LR
                                            −     ±                 ±
group (HA: z = 1.25  0.56; SD: z = 0.77 0.93). The resilience proﬁles of the 8 teachers who dropped
                   ±            −     ±
out of the MOM course were not included in the clustering procedure.
     The LR and HR groups were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in most of the baseline measurements (see
Table2). First of all, they were di ﬀerent in terms of HA and SD z-scores; this means that the clustering
procedure could successfully separate the participants according to their HA and SD features. Moreover,
participants in the HR had signiﬁcantly higher baseline scores in the AWA, NJU and NRE facets of the
FFMQ, lower AE scores in the QCAE, higher scores in the NWO and SRE scales of the MAIA, higher
scores in all scales of the PWB, lower anxiety and depression scores in the HADS, and lower EE and
higher DP and PA scores in the MBI (Hypothesis H1).

3.2. Objective 2: Pre–Post MOM Changes in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Proﬁles

3.2.1. Mindfulness Skills
     The raw scores in each FFMQ scale were normalized by dividing the observed scores by the
number of items in each scale (eight items for each scale except for the NJU scale, which has seven
items). The overall sample total FFMQ score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.91 (time T0) and 0.93 (time T1).
     The ANOVA on the normalized FFMQ scores highlighted three signiﬁcant main eﬀects: a main
eﬀect of Time (F(1,56) = 9.7, p = 0.003, ηP2 = 0.303) with increased scores at Time T1 (vs. T0), a main
eﬀect of Group (F(1,56) = 13.6, p[GG] < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.195) with increased scores in the HR group (vs.
LR), and a main eﬀect of Scale (F(4,224) = 5.4, p[GG] = 0.001, ηP2 = 0.203), with signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in between-scale scores. A signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect between Time and Scale was found (F(4,224) =
2.8, p[GG] = 0.03, ηP2 = 0.048), due to diﬀerent improvements over time in the ﬁve scales. Other two-
or three-way interactions were not signiﬁcant (all F < 2.4, p > 0.12, ηP2 < 0.041).

3.2.2. Empathy
     The overall sample QCAE score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.67 (time T0) and 0.85 (time T1) for AE and
0.76 (time T0) and 0.80 (time T1) for CE.
     In the AE scores, the ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of Time (F(1,56) = 17.5, p < 0.001,
ηP2 = 0.238) with an overall decrease in scores from T0 to T1, and a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of Group
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                     11 of 22

(F(1,56) = 9.9, p = 0.003, ηP2 = 0.150), with higher scores in the LR group (vs. HR). There were no
other signiﬁcant main eﬀects or interactions in the AE or in the CE scores (all F(1,56) < 1.6, p > 0.21,
ηP2 < 0.028).

3.2.3. Personality Proﬁle
     Individual raw  scores on each TCI scale were converted to z-scores using the age- and
gender-matched average scores of a control sample consisting of 320 healthy individuals (Table S3
in [84]).
     The overall sample TCI temperament score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.74 (time T0) and 0.68 (time T1)
for NS, 0.85 (time T0) and 0.82 (time T1) for HA, 0.65 (time T0) and 0.51 (time T1) for RD, and 0.58
(time T0) and 0.53 (time T1) for P. In the temperament scales of TCI, the ANOVAs revealed a main eﬀect
of Group in the HA and RD scales (F(1,56) = 65.7, p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.540 for HA; F(1,56) = 6.0, p = 0.02,
ηP2 = 0.097 for RD). Participants of the LR group had higher scores than participants in the HR group
in both scales. A signiﬁcant main eﬀect of Time was also observed in the HA scale (F(1,56) = 28.6,
p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.338), with an overall decrease in HA scores from T0 to T1.
     The overall sample TCI character score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.80 (time T0) and 0.80 (time T1).
The ANOVA on the character scales of TCI highlighted three signiﬁcant main eﬀects: a main eﬀect of
Group (F(1,56) = 12.8, p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.186), with higher scores in the HR group (vs. LR), a main
eﬀect of Time (F(1,56) = 23.7, p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.298), with an overall increase in scores from T0 to T1,
and a main eﬀect of Scale (F(2,112) = 6.8, p[GG] = 0.003, ηP2 = 0.108), with the C and ST scores being
greater than the SD scores (z = 4.9, p < 0.001 and z = 5.2, p < 0.001, respectively). The ANOVA also
highlighted two signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects: an interaction eﬀect between Group and Scale (F(2,112)
= 8.2, p[GG] < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.127), with a between-group diﬀerence in SD scores but not in C and ST
scores, and an interaction eﬀect between Group and Time (F(1,56) = 5.6, p = 0.02, ηP2 = 0.090), with
scores improving over time more in the LR (χ2(1) = 29.1, p < 0.001) than in the HR group (χ2(1) = 2.9,
p = 0.09).

3.2.4. Interoceptive Awareness
     The overall sample MAIA score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.90 (time T0) and 0.90 (time T1). Signiﬁcant
main eﬀects of Group were found in the NWO and SRE scales (F(1,56) = 8.2, p = 0.006, ηP2 = 0.128;
F(1,56) = 9.0, p = 0.004, ηP2 = 0.138, respectively), where scores were higher in the HR than in the
LR group.
     Signiﬁcant main eﬀects of Time were found in six of the eight MAIA scales (NOT, ARE, EAW,
SRE, BLI, TRU) (for all F(1,56) > 7.6, p < 0.008, ηP2 > 0.120), with an increase of scores from T0 to T1.
All other main eﬀects and interactions were not signiﬁcant (for all F(1,56) < 2.7, p > 0.11, ηP2 < 0.046).

3.2.5. Psychological Well-Being
     The overall sample PWB score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.85 (time T0) and 0.85 (time T1). Signiﬁcant
main eﬀects of Group were found in all PWB scales except PR (for all F(1,56) > 5.8, p < 0.02, ηP2 > 0.109):
scores in the SA, AU, EM, PG and PL scales were higher in the HR vs. LR group. Signiﬁcant main
eﬀects of Time were observed in the AU, EM and PR scales (for all F(1,56) > 7.9, p < 0.007, ηP2 > 0.124),
with an increase of scores from T0 to T1. A signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect between Group and Time
was observed in the PR scale (F(1,56) = 8.7, p = 0.005, ηP2 = 0.134), with scores improving over time
signiﬁcantly in the LR (χ2(1) = 25.6, p < 0.001) but not in the HR group (χ2(1) = 0.3, p = 0.55).

3.2.6. Emotional Distress
     The overall sample HADS score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.84 (time T0) and 0.81 (time T1). Signiﬁcant
main eﬀects of Group were found in the anxiety and depression scores (F(1,56) = 14.2, p < 0.001,
ηP2 = 0.202; F(1,56) = 9.1, p = 0.004, ηP2 = 0.139, respectively): scores in the LR were higher than
in the HR group. Signiﬁcant main eﬀects of Time were also observed in the anxiety and depression
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                     12 of 22

scores (F(1,56) = 8.7, p = 0.005, ηP2 = 0.135; F(1,56) = 13.8, p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.198, respectively), with
an overall decrease in scores from T0 to T1. A signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect between Group and Time
was observed in depression scores (F(1,56) = 5.3, p = 0.03, ηP2 = 0.086), corresponding to a signiﬁcant
decrease in scores in the LR group from T0 to T1 (χ2(1) = 20.1, p < 0.001), but not in the HR group.
Due to the diﬀerent decrease of depression scores in the two groups, the between-group diﬀerence in
depression scores was signiﬁcant at T0 (χ2(1) = 13.6, p < 0.001), but not at T1 (χ2(1) = 3.2, p = 0.07).

3.2.7. Teacher Burnout
     The overall sample MBI score’s Cronbach’s α was 0.88 (time T0) and 0.87 (time T1). Signiﬁcant
main eﬀects of Group were found in the EE component of burnout (F(1,56) = 17.7, p < 0.001, ηP2 = 0.240),
with higher scores in the LR (vs. HR) group, and in the PA component of burnout (F(1,56) = 10.4,
p = 0.002, ηP2 = 0.157), with higher scores in the HR (vs. LR) group. A signiﬁcant main eﬀect of Time
was observed in the EE component (F(1,56) = 6.7, p = 0.01, ηP2 = 0.108), with an overall decrease in
scores from T0 to T1. All other main eﬀects and interactions were not signiﬁcant (for all F(1,56) < 2.6,
p > 0.11, ηP2 < 0.044).

3.2.8. Adherence to Practice
     Each teacher reportedly meditated on average for 1307.7 22.5 min during the MOM  course
                                                           ±
(i.e., about 26 min per day). The teachers in the HR group reportedly meditated more than teachers in
the LR group, but this diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant (average meditation practice during the MOM
course in the LR group: 1277.4 220.9 min; in the HR group: 1338.4 224.2 min).
                             ±                                 ±
     In sum, the data on the pre–post MOM change showed that both groups signiﬁcantly improved
in terms of mindfulness skills, aﬀective empathy, harm avoidance, character traits (with greater
improvements in the low-resilience group) and interoceptive awareness, supporting Hypothesis
H2. Both groups signiﬁcantly improved also in terms of psychological well-being (in the scales of
autonomy, environmental mastery and positive relations with others), anxiety, depression (with greater
improvements in the low-resilience group), and in the emotional exhaustion scale of burnout.

3.3. Objective 3: Teachers’ Satisfaction with the MOM Course (in General and in the Context of the
Covid-19 Outbreak)

Evaluation of the MOM Course
     When asked at T1 about their satisfaction with the course (Q1–Q6, see Table1), the participants
reported that they generally enjoyed the course (average score: 4.1, SD = 0.7), that they found it rather
challenging (M = 3.7, SD = 0.9) but quite useful (M = 4.0, SD = 0.7), that they considerably engaged in it
(M = 3.9, SD = 0.6), that the course moderately met their professional training needs (M = 3.6, SD = 0.8)
and that the instructors’ competence was very good (M = 4.5, SD = 0.6). A signiﬁcant between-group
diﬀerence was found only in the question about the usefulness of the course (in the LR group: M = 3.81,
SD  = 0.69; in the HR group: M = 4.15, SD = 0.73; Fisher’s exact test p = 0.046).
     In the questions about the course in the context of the Covid-19 lockdown (Q7–Q10, see Table1),
the participants reported that thinking about Covid-19 distracted them slightly during practice sessions
(M = 2.5, SD = 0.9), that the practice of meditation helped them very much during the particular period
of isolation related to the emergency (M = 3.6, SD = 0.7), that the absence of the practice would have
made the period a little worse (M = 1.9, SD = 0.6) and that the distance learning methods of the last six
meetings of the MOM   course somewhat reduced the eﬀectiveness of the course (M = 2.1, SD = 0.7).
No signiﬁcant between-group diﬀerences were found in these questions (for all, Fisher’s exact test
p > 0.26).
     Finally, we investigated whether there was any between-group diﬀerence in the relationship
between the responses given in the questions concerning the MOM course in the context of the Covid-19
outbreak (Q7–Q10) and the pre/post changes in some of the tests used (namely TCI, PWB and HADS,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                     13 of 22

the tests where a signiﬁcant interaction between Group and Time was detected in the ANOVAs).
This analysis was performed using multinomial logistic regressions, separately for each question, using
Group membership (LR, HR) and responses (properly dichotomized into two levels) to the question as
predictor variables, and changes in the test scores from before to after the MOM course as outcome
variables. A signiﬁcant result was found only for question Q9 (“How do you think you would have
lived this period without the practice?”), the responses to which were dichotomized with ‘0’ for “much
worse” responses and ‘1’ for responses from “somewhat worse” to “much better”, in relationship with
the HADS Anxiety change scores. The pre/post MOM    change in the Anxiety scores was predicted,
by Q9 responses, diﬀerently in the two groups (b = 0.81, p = 0.02): in the LR group the changes in
                                                 −
the Anxiety scores were not related to Q9 responses (r = 0.10, p = 0.57), while in the HR group these
changes were negatively related to Q9 responses (r = 0.53, p = 0.005). This means that, for the HR
                                                  −
group only, the more the Anxiety scores decreased, the more participants felt that they would have
had more diﬃculty living through the lockdown period without the meditation practice.

4. Discussion
     In the present study, a sample of female teachers was assessed one month before and one
month after the imposition of the Covid-19 lockdown in Italy, and received a mindfulness meditation
intervention during these two months. The personality proﬁles of the participants at baseline were
used to classify the participants into a low-resilience group and a high-resilience group. The scores
obtained from the teachers in the self-report measures were studied as a function of time (pre- vs.
post-course) and group (low- vs. high-resilience).

4.1. Objective 1: Baseline Diﬀerences in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Proﬁles
     Results largely supported H1: the analysis of data at baseline revealed that the low-resilience
group had signiﬁcantly worse average scores than the high-resilience group in terms of personality
proﬁles (by the deﬁnition of the two groups), mindfulness skills, aﬀective empathy, interoceptive
awareness, psychological well-being, anxiety, depression and burnout levels. This between-group
diﬀerence is in line with previous research that found resilience to be directly related, on the one hand,
to mindfulness [50], psychological well-being [48] and interoceptive awareness [51], and on the other
hand, inversely related to burnout [53], anxiety and depression [52].

4.2. Objective 2: Pre–Post MOM Changes in Teachers with LR and HR Personality Proﬁles
     The results also supported H2; at the end of the course, one month after the lockdown was
imposed, signiﬁcant improvements were observed in both groups in most of the self-report measures.
Both groups had signiﬁcantly improved scores in mindfulness skills, aﬀective empathy, harm avoidance,
character traits (especially participants in the low-resilience group) and interoceptive awareness (H2),
as well as in psychological well-being (in the scales of autonomy, environmental mastery and positive
relations with others), anxiety, depression (especially in the low-resilience group) and emotional
exhaustion. These positive results in the measures used in our study could be related to participants’
adherence to practice (participants’ home practice in our study was about 88% of the assigned amount),
which was similar in the two groups and could be classiﬁed as good compared to other standard
introductory MBIs [85,86]; various studies have indeed highlighted a direct dose–response relationship
between the amount of meditation practice and the extent of the beneﬁcial outcomes of MBIs (for a
meta-analysis, see [87]), and in the case of online MBIs as well (for a meta-analysis, see [37]). It is indeed
worth pointing out that mindfulness meditation was taught here with two face-to-face initial meeting
and video lessons sent via internet for the next six weeks of the course (see Figure1); our results
therefore conﬁrm the possibility of eﬀectively delivering MBIs via the internet [37,38].
     During the early stages of the Covid-19 epidemic, many researchers reported the need to provide
interventions to support the mental health of people aﬀected by the Covid-19 crisis [15,16,19,87,88],
in particular for healthcare workers [18,89–91] and patients with the Covid-19 infection [92,93]. For this
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6450                                     14 of 22

purpose, many scholars suggested the use of mindfulness interventions [94–97]. However, studies
assessing the impact of interventions that supported mental health in the early stages of the Covid-19
related crisis are very limited. Although the improvements reported in the present study cannot be
attributed to the MOM course given the absence of a control group, the results seem remarkable, as we
are not aware of any studies reporting improved psychological well-being when comparing persons
during the Covid-19 outbreak with their precedent condition. Various studies instead reported a
deterioration of people’s mental health [5,6,98,99]. At the same time, it should be recognized that
our research focused on a speciﬁc population, namely state school teachers, who might have been
less impacted by the emergency than other workers, as their jobs were not at risk and they were not
professionally exposed to the risk of the infection (as were, for example, health care workers). Although
a recent meta-analysis on the psychological impact of Covid-19 on medical staﬀ and the general public
found that the prevalence of anxiety and depression was similar in these two groups [100], there is
evidence that certain occupations, such as front-line nurses, were indeed more psychologically aﬀected
by Covid-19 than others [101,102].
     In our study, for most of the measurements where the improvements were observed, the rate of
change over time was generally similar in the two groups of teachers diﬀering in terms of resilience.
Since the two groups were diﬀerent at baseline in most of the measurements, the ﬁnal data generally
showed that the low-resilience and the high-resilience groups were still diﬀerent after the MOM
course in the dimensions in which they diﬀered at baseline (mindfulness skills, aﬀective empathy,
harm avoidance, the self-regulation scale of interoceptive awareness, the autonomy and environmental
mastery scales of psychological well-being, anxiety and emotional exhaustion) and still similar in the
dimensions for which they were comparable at baseline (the noticing, attention regulation, emotional
awareness, body listening and trusting scales of interoceptive awareness). This pattern was diﬀerent
in the “positive relation with others” (PR) scale of psychological well-being, in character traits,
in depression scores and in the total score of emotional distress, wherein the low-resilience individuals
showed greater improvement than the high-resilience individuals (see the Time X Group interactions
reported in Table3). LR individuals therefore made better progresses than HR participants, although
both groups reported the same amount of home meditation practice. This could be due, at least in part,
to ceiling eﬀects, because highly resilient individuals already showed healthy proﬁles at baseline for
these measures. The ﬁndings could also be linked to diﬀerent levels of motivation, across HR and LR
participants, to commit themselves to the mindfulness intervention, which is usually presented as a way
to alleviate one’s psychological suﬀering [103]; as described in our previous research [36] and similarly
to the reactive control negative feedback process proposed in many theories of self-regulation [104],
participants who are in a worse condition (i.e., the LR group in our study) could be more motivated to
engage for their own recovery.
     It is important to underline that the scores for the personality traits used to deﬁne resilience in
our study (i.e., harm avoidance and self-directedness) also improved in both LR and HR groups in
the present study. Resilience is indeed considered a modiﬁable characteristic [105] and, during the
Covid-19 pandemic, it has been related to modiﬁable factors such as physical exercise and interpersonal
relationships [106]. However, as observed in other measures of the present research, at the end of
the training course the two groups in our study remained signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in terms of the two
aforementioned personality traits, and therefore in terms of resilience.

4.3. Objective 3: Teachers’ Satisfaction with the MOM Course (in General and in the Context of the
Covid-19 Outbreak)
     The answers to the questions about general satisfaction with the MOM course supported H3a;
teachers generally enjoyed the course, found it challenging but useful, engaged in it and appreciated
the work of the instructors and the course content for their professional training needs. In addition to
these positive responses from the teachers who completed the course, the teachers’ satisfaction with
the course itself can also be expressed by the number of teachers who dropped out (11.9% of drop-out
in our study), which, in the present study, can be classiﬁed as medium-to-low when compared to
the corresponding past literature [30,107–109]. The answers to the questions about the course in the
context of the Covid-19 outbreak supported H3b; participants in general reported that the practice
of meditation helped them during the particular period of isolation related to the health emergency,
and that the absence of the practice would have made the period a little worse.
     Finally, teachers’ evaluation of the MOM course was analyzed in relation to the two diﬀerent
resilience proﬁles of participants. Some between-group diﬀerences were observed. Although teachers
generally appreciated the course and actively engaged in it, those in the low-resilience group reported
signiﬁcantly lower scores than their colleagues in the high-resilience group when asked about the
usefulness of the course. This is quite surprising, because both groups equally beneﬁted from the
course, and the low-resilience group even had greater improvements in the emotional distress and
character traits scores. Moreover, for the question on how one would have lived during the Covid-19
lockdown period without practicing mindfulness meditation, only teachers in the high-resilience group
gave answers that appeared to be coherent with their self-reported decrease in anxiety levels: the more
the anxiety scores decreased after vs. before the MOM course, the more the participants reported
that the same period would have been much worse without the meditation practice. Both aspects
that emerged from the answers to these questions suggest that less resilient individuals could have
been less able to explicitly recognize the positive changes following the MOM training during the
emergency situation. This should be taken into account in future mindfulness interventions in this
type of context, in particular to motivate people to continue to use the learned technique even after the
end of the intervention.

4.4. Limitations
     Some limitations should be noted in our study. First, both LR and HR groups received the same
intervention; for the generalizability of our ﬁndings, a control group should have been employed.
Second, again in relation to the issue of generalizability, future studies should include samples with
younger participants than those included in our study, because younger teachers may react to states of
emergency, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, diﬀerently than older teachers. Third, only self-report
measures were used, which can be susceptible to socially desirable responding. Moreover, the questions
about the evaluation of the MOM course were not taken from a validated instrument: in order to further
explore how participants ﬁnd and accept psychological/behavioral interventions, future studies could
beneﬁt from using instruments such as the theoretical framework of acceptability [110]. A ﬁnal issue
concerns individuals’ spirituality. In diﬀerent contexts and with diﬀerent participants, past studies
showed, on the one hand, that MOM    practice may contribute to enhancing individuals’ levels of
implicit and explicit spirituality, [62] and, on the other hand, that spirituality is an important mediator
of the positive health eﬀects of mindfulness meditation [111]. Considering the strong connections
between spirituality and healthcare (e.g., [112]), it might have been useful to explicitly test spirituality
in our study (beyond the self-transcendence scale included in the TCI measuring the predisposition of
human beings toward spiritual feeling, thinking and behaviors), and it might be important that future
studies investigating the psychological impact of health emergencies, and the eﬀectiveness of related
interventions, include the dimension of people’s spirituality (e.g., [113]).

5. Conclusions
     We have shown that it is possible through mindfulness meditation to enhance the resilience and
improve the well-being of school teacher participants during critical events, such as the Covid-19
lockdown in Italy. This was seen to occur both in female individuals with resilient personality proﬁles
and in female individuals with weaker personality traits. The factors that, in our case, may have
determined this success were as follows: (1) a consolidated and evidence-based program that was
provided by institutional services, (2) the intervention started before the beginning of the pandemic
(i.e., in a preventive approach) [114] and (3) the participants actively engaged daily in the practice of
meditation to protect and promote their mental health.
