The Benefits of Mindfulness Meditation for Stress
Reduction
PROF. DR. PARIN SOMANI

Abstract-Over the course of the last several decades,
there has been a meteoric rise in the amount of
interest shown in the study of mindfulness both as a
psychological construct and as a method of
therapeutic intervention. This article provides an
overview of the empirical research on the impact that
mindfulness practises have on psychological health.
We begin with a discussion of the construct of
mindfulness, the differences between Buddhist and
Western psychological conceptualizations of
mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been
integrated into Western medicine and psychology.
Next, we review three areas of empirical research:
cross-sectional, correlational research on the
associations between mindfulness and various
indicators of psychological health; intervention
research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented
interventions; and so on. Our research has led us to
the conclusion that practising mindfulness can have
a number of beneficial benefits on a person's psyche,
the most notable of which are improvements in
behavioural regulation, reduced psychiatric
symptoms, and greater subjective well-being. This
review comes to a close with a discussion on the
underlying processes of change brought about by
mindfulness therapies, as well as some suggestions
for the next steps in study..

I. INTRODUCTION
It is becoming increasingly common procedure to use
psychological therapies that are based on mindfulness
skills for the treatment of a wide variety of mental
disorders. This type of treatment is becoming
increasingly standard technique [1]. Training oneself
in mindfulness entails paying undivided attention in
the here and now to sensations and ideas, both internal
and external, without attaching any significance or
meaning to those experiences and thoughts. When
practised in the correct manner, mindfulness has the
potential to assist improvement in areas of cognition
related with openness to experience, objectivity, and
meta-cognitive. The practising of mindfulness has
been linked to an extensive list of health advantages,
all of which have been demonstrated to be attributable
to the practise of mindfulness.[2] According to the
research that is now available, mindfulness training
may be effective in the management of pain
management programmes, the treatment of
depression, and the reduction of somatic disorders, to
name just a few of these potential applications. Despite
the growing popularity of mindfulness training in the
field of psychotherapy, there has been a very limited
amount of research conducted on the topic. The
purpose of this study was to disentangle the effects of
mindfulness meditation on stress-related symptoms,
depression-related symptoms, and anxiousness-related
symptoms.
• Mindfulness Training and Depression
It has been established that engaging in regular
meditation practises can be beneficial in the treatment
of depression. In order to accomplish this goal,
ruminative tendencies are suppressed while
improvements are made to attentional control.
"Ruminating" refers to the mental processes that
individuals go through, such as how they react to the
ideas that they have in their minds. On the other hand,
"what's in people's heads" may be viewed of as
dysfunctional attitudes and negative self-beliefs.
Because it is a process that "recycles" the unpleasant
mental content, ruminating is associated with an
increased risk of a depressive episode and a more
severe manifestation of the condition in those who are
genetically prone to developing depression.

People who suffer from depression may find relief
through meditation in two different ways: first, by
increasing awareness of the here and now, depressed
clients learn to redirect their focus from ruminating on
negative self-referential information to attending to
and processing all relevant information; and second,
by allowing themselves to feel whatever emotions
arise, meditators learn to minimise the impact that
negative emotions have on maintaining maladaptive
thought patterns. A new clinical trial demonstrates that
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is an effective
treatment for decreasing symptoms of depression and
avoiding the return of the condition[3]. Even while
MBCT was not as effective for everyone who was
depressed, the great majority of persons who had
previously struggled with depression showed
considerable and long-lasting improvement after
participating in the programme. On the other hand,
those who have struggled with depression more than
twice are more likely to be resistive to the full
advantages of treatment since depression is frequently
triggered by unfavourable living situations. Instruction
in Meditation
• Mindfulness Training and Anxiety
The practise of meditation is increasingly being
included into the treatment of a wide variety of anxiety
issues. The attentional and arousal theories of anxiety
are the primary drivers of the logic behind utilising
meditation as a treatment for anxiety. (Bogels &
Mansell, 2004; Hunt, Keogh, & French, 2006)
Research has shown that anxious people are more
prone to perceive a danger in circumstances and texts
that are ambiguous. People who suffer from anxiety
sometimes have a tendency to see ambiguous
information as dangerous.[4] People who suffer from
severe anxiety disorders typically have continually
elevated levels of arousal, which increases the
likelihood that these individuals would incorrectly
interpret ambiguous environmental information as
being hazardous. People who suffer from anxiety and
take part in intervention programmes that are based on
meditation are taught to 'observe' their thoughts and
bodily sensations without passing judgement on them,
in a manner very similar to those who go through
therapy for depression. An objective acknowledgment
and investigation of one's physiological issues is the
initial step, and it is also the phase that is the most
important. In contrast to the focus that is placed in
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the evaluation
of physiological symptoms, cognitive therapy
instructs patients to view their own thoughts and
behaviours as recurring patterns.
• Mindfulness Training and Stress Reduction
Training in mindfulness is most commonly thought of
in relation to alleviating stress as a kind of therapeutic
intervention. Irritability, excessive concern, and overarousal are just a few of the many different
physiological and cognitive states that fall under the
umbrella term of stress.[5]
Occupations, illnesses with a grave prognosis, or the
development of psychological problems can all be
factors in the development of chronic stress. Despite
the fact that they have only been around for a short
while, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
courses have already demonstrated that they are
beneficial in a variety of settings. This is evidenced by
the positive findings of a number of research studies
that have been conducted on the advantages of these
courses. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, often
known as MBSR, was at first developed as a method
of treating persistent pain in the medical field. The
training is delivered to the participants in small groups,
which typically range in size from 20 to 30 individuals
each. The typical length of a session is between two
and two and a half hours, and it consists of active
meditation skill training together with discussions on
stress reactions, directions for between-session
exercises, and other topics. The duration of the training
typically ranges from eight to ten weeks.[6]
Participants in the Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR) course are given instruction in
both conventional mindfulness practises as well as an
exercise that lasts for 45 minutes and is dubbed "body
scan." The participants are instructed to concentrate on
and pay great attention to the feelings that they feel in
different areas of their bodies. The 'body scan' may
have the same outward look as the progressive muscle
relaxation method (PMRT), but it does not need the
conscious control of muscles. Instead, the focus of
attention is placed on the sensations that arise as a
result of the natural functions of the body.

II. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
1. To study on Mindfulness Training and Stress
Reduction
2. To study on Mindfulness Training and Depression
The rationale that underpins the 'body scan' technique
is based on the idea that people who have high levels
of arousal and stress are more likely to experience
physiological symptoms (such as muscle tension), and
that paying attention to these symptoms while
maintaining a nonjudgmental frame of mind will
reduce these physical responses. This is the reasoning
that underpins the technique. When it comes to
alleviating stress, meditating acts in a way that is
cognitively analogous to the treatment of mental
health illnesses such as anxiety and depression. The
focus of attention is then brought back to the here and
now when judgemental concepts, such as those about
the reason of stress, are merely noticed for as long as
they continue to exist, after which it is brought back to
the present moment. Individuals who meditate on a
regular basis experience cognitive shifts as a result of
this exercise and grow in their capacity for selfmanagement adaptations as a direct result of these
shifts. The consequences of engaging in this technique
are multifaceted. Because mindfulness training
increases the awareness of all emotional and cognitive
processes as they occur in the present moment,
individuals are able to recognise the warning signals
of stress building up because they are able to perceive
them. As soon as a person has gained the skills of'
metacognitive awareness,' formerly difficult safety
behaviours and cognitions become more controlled,
allowing them to exercise more control over them.[7]
III. METHODS
Not only the processes that were to be followed, but
also the prerequisites for eligibility, could be found in
the protocol.
The objective is to train oneself to become aware of
each fleeting moment without attaching any value or
importance to it. Instruction in many conventional
meditation techniques will be provided. putting a
focus on the need of regular and consistent practise.
Instead of receiving education on an individual basis,
group treatments were provided. Students were
obliged to sit in meditation for around two and a half
hours each week during the duration of each class,
which may last anywhere from six to twelve weeks.
There were quantitative assessments of the outcomes
that could be obtained. The dimensions of a person's
mental health can be a consequence, or the dimensions
of their physical health might be a result. Both are
possible results. The outcome was evaluated using
scales that had been standardised and independently
validated by a third party. Impact sizes were able to be
calculated thanks to the fact that information on each
trial was freely available.[8]
In randomised controlled trials, active techniques of
controlling for the nonspecific effects of the
mindfulness group (such as social support, demand
characteristics, and expectation effects) were chosen
over passive ones (such as a wait-list). Active
approaches included things like social support,
demand characteristics, and expectancy effects.[9]
Data were submitted and evaluated following the
intervention; however, this assessment did not always
include data on any later incidents.
• Study coding
The second author, LN, was in charge of coding all of
the papers that were included in the analysis because
they met the aforementioned inclusion criteria. The
studies were analysed and coded in accordance with
the following criteria: study design (controlled study,
observational study, follow-up data), group allocation
(randomization, quasi experimental), type of control
(waiting list, no treatment, treatment as usual, active
control), study population (patients, nonpatients,
students, inmates, etc.), patients' diagnoses, and
outcome measures. After that, the original author (PG)
reviewed all of the code for accuracy a second
time.[10]
• Data selection and extraction
Our purpose in doing this meta-analysis was to
investigate the ways in which the practise of
mindfulness meditation influenced a variety of health
indicators. When we discussed what it means to be
healthy, we took into account both one's physical and
mental well-being. Everything that might possibly
have been assessed as an outcome was either
accounted for within the category of "physical health"
© OCT 2023 | IRE Journals | Volume 7 Issue 4 | ISSN: 2456-8880
IRE 1705135 ICONIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING JOURNALS 348
or "mental health," or else it was simply not measured
at all. In order to collect all of the data for this study,
standardised and validated scales were utilised. Some
examples of these scales include the Global Severity
Inventory of Symptom Check List—R, the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Beck Depression
Inventory, the Profile of Mood States, the McGillMelzack Pain-Rating Scale, the Short Form 36 Health
Survey, and the Medical Symptom Checklist. A full
list of these scales is available upon request.
Measurements of egocentrism, spiritual experience,
empathy, neuropsychological function, social support,
and the application of a conservative approach were
not included in the study because of the unknown or
unconventional character of these factors.[11]
Measures of a person's ''mental health'' have
traditionally included things like the individual's state
of mind and their symptomatology; their degree of
depression, anxiety, and sleep; their psychological
components of quality of life; and their emotional
experience of pain. The ideas of "medical symptoms,"
"physical pain," "physical impairment," and "the
physical component of quality of life questionnaires"
are all examples of concepts that fall within the
"physical health" umbrella.
Throughout their conversations, LN, PG, and HW (the
last author) were able to come to a consensus about the
inclusion and distribution of outcome measures. This
consensus served as the basis for all choices. Data
pertaining to each of the measures that were utilised in
the study were extracted and entered into a spreadsheet
created in Excel.
Since a large number of studies did not collect followup data and the amount of time that passed between
post-intervention evaluations ranged widely, we
decided to focus our attention on examining the shortterm impacts of mindfulness training rather than its
long-term advantages.[12] It was essential to carry out
these steps due to the delicate character of the research.
Our findings simply reflect the presence or lack of
acute reactions; they do not take into account the longterm repercussions.
• Effect size calculation
To determine the amount of the Cohen's d effect, we
divided the mean difference by the pooled standard
deviation of the data. We used two different kinds of
mean differences: (i) the difference between the
treatment group and the control group (which is a
difference between the groups), and (ii) the difference
between the posttreatment and the pretreatment group
(which is a difference within the groups). Because
there were a very limited number of controlled studies
that fit the requirements, and numerous quite
thoroughly done uncontrolled observational studies
that did conform to the criteria, we decided to include
the latter, within-group analysis. In addition, we
thought that it could be instructive to compare the
effect sizes of other types of controlled research,
including observation studies, randomised controlled
trials, and quasi-experimental controlled trials.[13]
In the first scenario, (i), posttreatment data are often
included into the calculation under the assumption that
there was no significant change in the baseline
conditions between the groups before the intervention.
We generated two effect sizes since it was not possible
to constantly maintain this assumption for our data set.
One effect size was based on the pretreatment values
(baseline difference), while the other effect size was
based on the posttreatment values. When the effect
size for the postintervention values was subtracted
from the effect size for the baseline difference, the
result was the final effect size that was entered into the
meta-analysis. For the purpose of computing the (ii)
pre–post effect sizes, it is necessary to have a
correlation between the preintervention measures and
the postintervention ones[14]. Because the study
reports did not provide information that would allow
us to derive this correlation, we made a best guess and
inserted it into the calculation as r =.7. All effect sizes
were adjusted to account for the potential bias
introduced by having a small sample size using a
straightforward calculation that Hedges gave.
• Data aggregation
After that, we calculated the means of each impact size
to produce two separate effect sizes: one for mental
health and one for physical health. Both of these effect
sizes were then merged into the original research. If
there was a difference in the sample size from one
scale of the research to another, we weighted it for N.
The effect sizes produced in this method were then
aggregated across investigations by computing a
weighted mean, where the inverse of the estimated

IRE 1705135 ICONIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING JOURNALS 349
standard deviation for each research acted as a weight
[8]. This allowed the effect sizes to be compared more
accurately. The standard error of the total mean effect
size was used as the basis for calculating confidence
intervals (CI), which were based on those results.
• Overall and sensitivity analyses
Two independent meta-analyses were carried out, and
their findings were subsequently combined. In the first
analysis, data from all controlled studies were taken
into consideration, and the size of the impact was
determined by comparing the two different groups. In
the second analysis, researchers looked at randomised
controlled trials (which concentrated largely on the
benefits of the mindfulness intervention) as well as
observational studies (which did not include a control
or comparison group). In order to reach a conclusion,
we pooled together all of the effect estimates that were
derived from studies that compared pre-training and
post-training measurements for groups that had
undergone mindfulness training. In their own research,
we computed the average impact sizes for both mental
and physical health. In order to get the data set
available for sensitivity analyses for several groups, it
was partitioned, and then separate analyses were
performed on each subset of the data.[15]
IV. RESULTS
We were able to retrieve 64 research, but only 20
reports, with a total of 1605 participants, satisfied the
inclusion requirements (these reports are marked in the
References section with an asterisk and in the Further
Readings section; please note that several studies were
given in more than one publication). In the appendix,
you will find a list of all of the studies that were
obtained.
A. Most of the excluded studies did not operationalize
with wi standing for the cumulative significance of
each individual's study. The calculation of two-tailed
P values involved the application of the formula z =
d/SEd to determine a z score, which was then utilised
in the computation of the value. By generating a
formula that produces a Q value, we were able to
conduct an analysis on the homogeneity of treatment
effects across all of the trials. This formula is v2
distributed with df = k 1, where k is the number of
papers that were considered for inclusion in the test.
Either they did not cultivate mindfulness in the
specified manner, or they did not offer sufficient
statistical information for an effect size estimate.
Either way, the results of the study cannot be trusted.
Patients suffering from fibromyalgia, mixed cancer
diagnoses, coronary artery diseases, depression,
chronic pain, anxiety, obesity and binge eating
disorder, as well as psychiatric patients, participated in
research that studied the effects of mindfulness
training on medical patients.[16] The other three
findings were based on nonclinical samples of
individuals who desired to improve their capacity to
cope with stress. Two of the findings were based on
populations of inmates, while the other two findings
were based on populations of persons who were
incarcerated.

study are included in these numbers.[17]
There are several distinct scales contained within the
N, Nt, and Nc ranges.
• Controlled studies
Thirteen of the studies that had the potential to be
included conducted some kind of comparison group
analysis. Because of the constraints described below,
we were unable to include the results of three more
research in our analysis. One piece of research
compared the efficacy of psychoeducational courses to
that of the practise of mindfulness meditation.
Psychoeducational programmes have a strong
reputation for being successful. Even while this wasn't
a "control" strategy in the way that we understood that
term, it was nonetheless a comparative research. On
the other hand, the findings of this research can be
located under the section entitled "Observational
Studies" farther down the page. Two additional studies
only offered follow-up information; however, neither
of these studies disclosed posttreatment assessments
within the time range appropriate for our analysis, and
as a consequence, they were also discarded (these last
two reflect distinct outcomes from the same study).
Two more studies only provided follow-up
information. Randomization was carried out in an
appropriate manner in seven of the other ten research,
and a quasi-experimental methodology was utilised in
three of the studies. In each of the five investigations,
patients were invited to take part as volunteers, and the
researchers used a wide range of control methods (see
Table 1).
The outcomes of randomised controlled trials that are
important to mental health are summarised in Table 2,
which includes the mean effect size, the 95%
confidence interval, and the P value. In the data set that
is being reported on here, there are a total of 771
individuals; 388 of those people have participated in
mindfulness training.[18] The outcomes of the
subsamples have also been included in the table that
can be seen below. These outcomes were achieved by
further subdividing the dataset based on the subject
population (patients versus nonpatients) and group
allocation (randomization versus qua- experimental
control). Only five of the controlled trials really
measured anything related to the participants' physical
health as an outcome.
The factors that were discovered to be connected to
mental health were shown to be quite consistent across
the board (v2 = 0.89, df = 9, P =.999). The effect size,
which was evaluated as d = 0.54 with a 95%
confidence interval ranging from 0.39 to 0.68 and a
two-tailed P value of.0001, was medium-strong and
statistically significant.

Only for mental health measures are subgroups of
research with patients, nonpatients, randomised
design, and quasi-experimental design indicated. Due
to the extremely low number of studies that included
factors related to physical health, it was not possible to
accurately calculate distinct CIs.
Table 3 presents the effects of mindfulness training
based on a pre–post comparison for mental and
physical health variables (k, number of studies; N,
number of subjects; d, mean effect size; P value, twotailed). There were no significant differences found
between the subgroups for the variables subject

Only five of the controlled studies produced any data
that could even distantly be regarded to be on topic
with the discipline of physical health. Only five of the
controlled studies produced any data. The findings
cover a total population of 203 people, out of which
122 were given instructions on how to participate in
mindfulness practises. This particular data set was
shown to be homogenous by utilising a sample size
that was somewhat reduced from the original (v2 =
4.97, df = 4, P =.29). Table 2 has a summarised version
of the findings that you are welcome to peruse at your
leisure. This was done for your convenience.[19] This
effect size is comparable to that of the mental health
factors, and the estimated average impact size was d =
0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23–0.81, P
=.0004].
• Investigations that are based on actual observations
The findings of comparisons made between preintervention statuses and post-intervention statuses for
both sets of outcome measures (physical and mental
health) are provided in Table 3. These comparisons
were done for the purpose of determining whether
state was better, pre-intervention or post-intervention.
The comparisons in this study were made between the
two periods in time that came before and after the
intervention. In addition to the experiences of 894
people who had participated in mindfulness training,
the collection of data included information that was
acquired from a total of 18 distinct pieces of study. In
total, only nine studies with a combined total of 566
individuals were conducted to explore different
aspects of physical health. The outcomes of the
controlled trials gave effect sizes that were reasonably
comparable to the mean effect sizes obtained in the
study that was conducted without any controls being
used. In terms of mental health, these mean effect sizes
were d = 0.50 (95%-CI 0.43 – 0.56, P.0001), while in
terms of physical health, these mean effect sizes were
d = 0.42 (95%-CI 0.34 – 0.50, P.0001). The findings
of the controlled studies produced effect sizes that
were relatively equivalent to the mean effect sizes seen
in the studies that were not controlled.[20] The
homogeneity test was failed by the other set (mental
health v2 = 51.92, df = 17, P.0001); the set with
characteristics of physical health was the only one that
was confirmed to be homogenous (v2 = 11.45, df = 8,
P =.18). However, the homogeneity of the data was
only found in the set that comprised variables linked
to physical health. Both of the impact sizes are
significant.
Therefore, in order to determine if the subject
population functioned as a moderator of the impact,
we carried out a sensitivity analysis in order to analyse
its potential role. To determine whether or not this was
the case was the primary focus of our investigation.
According to the findings, each of the subgroups,
patients and others, possessed a considerable level of
heterogeneity (patients, v2 = 33.29, df = 12, P.001;
nonpatients, v2 = 15.84, df = 4, P =.003). Patients had
a much greater amount of variation compared to other
individuals. When compared to other persons, patients
had considerably higher levels of heterogeneity in
their data. Therefore, extreme caution is essential for
determining the importance of this mean impact
magnitude.
• Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
The findings of this study suggest that MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction (MBSR), more often referred
to as "mindfulness meditation," has the potential to be
an effective treatment for a wide variety of persistent
diseases and issues. Mindfulness practise has the
potential to improve not just the general parts of
coping with anguish and impairment in day-to-day
life, but also the more exceptional elements of coping

with extreme cases of disorder or stress. This is
demonstrated by the consistent and often considerable
level of effect sizes across a wide range of sample
types. Mindfulness training may also be helpful in
managing with anguish and incapacity in
circumstances that are more severe, such as major
disorders or intense stress. This study adds support to
the theory that training in mindfulness may enhance
these general features of coping with adversity and
disability. In point of fact, this discovery lends
credence to the hypothesis. Recent study that was only
very recently made accessible provides evidence for
the efficacy of mindfulness-based therapy. This
research was published not too long ago. In this
examination, new inclusion criteria were applied, in
addition to a technique that was only marginally
different from the one that had been used in the
previous study. In every one of these investigations,
there was evidence of benefits across a broad spectrum
of standardised mental health indicators. The
psychological components of quality of life scores,
depression, anxiety, coping style, and other emotional
aspects of disability were among those that improved
as a result of these interventions. In a similar vein,
identical improvements were also reported for the
health indicators of physical well-being, such as
medical symptoms, sensory discomfort, physical
impairment, and ratings of functional quality-oflife.[21] These findings are consistent with the
findings described in the previous paragraph. Despite
the fact that physically oriented metrics were explored
in the trials as a whole less often than other types of
measures, researchers were nevertheless able to detect
the benefits associated with these sorts of
measurements.
The advantages of mindfulness training have also been
attested to by the findings of other high-quality
research that was carried out by researchers who did
not adhere to our conditions regarding the amount of
time involved, the dependent measures, or the control
techniques. Although these studies did not meet our
requirement regarding timing, they did meet all of our
other criteria. In no way were our criteria for timing,
dependent measurements, or control techniques
implemented in any manner in these trials. For
instance, the one-year recurrence rates of major
depressive episodes were shown to be cut in half when
conventional treatment was supplemented by a
mindfulness programme in a recent randomised
research trial of depressives who were in remission.
The study was conducted on individuals who had
previously been diagnosed with depression and were
currently in a state of remission. The participants in the
research were people who had been given a diagnosis
of depression in the past but who were now considered
to be functioning normally. People who had a history
of undergoing therapy for depression were recruited to
take part in the study as participants. People who
suffered from anxiety and mood disorders and had
participated in mindfulness training showed
significant pre-to-postintervention improvements in
their mental health outcomes, with an effect size of
0.70, according to yet another study that looked into
the topic. These findings were discovered among
individuals who had previously participated in
mindfulness training.[22]
In our meta-analysis, we found that the consistency of
effect sizes across different types of research (such as
controlled vs observational) and within the controlledstudy analysis (active control versus wait list) does
give some support for the intervention's specificity.
This support comes from the fact that these effect sizes
were measured using the same criteria in both types of
research. For instance, controlled trials and
observational studies were able to offer information on
effect sizes that were equivalent to one another. The
fact that the results of both controlled experiments and
observational research came to the same findings
allowed us to provide evidence that this is the case.
The six controlled studies (see Table 1) that made use
of various types of active control intervention in order
to take into consideration the effects of therapy that
were either general or nonspecific are of particular
significance to this issue. These experiments were
conducted in order to determine whether or not the
effects of therapy were beneficial. These tests were
carried out in order to take into account the effects of
treatment that were not unique to any one patient in
particular.[24] These trials suggest that the mean
impact size of the intervention is around 0.49, which
is not too far off from and not considerably different
from the mean effect size found in the four wait-list
groups (d=0.58), which did not have control of the
majority of the intervention's nonspecific effects.[23]
There is not a large amount of distinction between the
two. However, one must approach such findings with

extreme caution due to the small number of overall
research and, in particular, randomised trials, the range
of different types of sample diagnoses, and the
inclusion of unpublished studies. All of these factors
combine to make it difficult to draw definitive
conclusions from the available evidence. It is tough to
make claims that are conclusive due to all of these
different elements. Due to the presence of all of these
problems, increased attention is necessary.[25]
CONCLUSION
The current research has a number of methodological
flaws that need to be solved before it can be considered
complete. Our internal and external validity is affected
negatively as a result of several factors, including the
absence of a control group design, statistical
regression, and extraneous variables. The size of the
results implies that mindfulness training has a good
influence on the emotional states of depression,
anxiety, and stress, and that it merits a place in
therapeutic considerations. Despite the fact that these
constraints may restrict the amount to which we can
generalise from the current findings, the data imply
that mindfulness training has a positive effect. As a
result, the findings presented here should be seen as an
indicator of how mindfulness training could contribute
to the treatment of emotional disorders, and it is
recommended that any future studies including
community samples take into account the limitations
discussed in this article...
