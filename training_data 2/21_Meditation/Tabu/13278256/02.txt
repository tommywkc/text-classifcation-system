I. INTRODUCTION
In the field of education, the role of teacher educators
is crucial as they shape the future of teaching and
learning. However, the demands and challenges faced
by teacher educators can often take a toll on their
overall wellbeing and, subsequently, their professional
performance. Recognizing the impact of general
wellbeing on teacher educators' performance is
essential in creating a nurturing and supportive
environment that promotes effectiveness and
resilience among educators. The term "general
wellbeing" refers to a state of holistic wellness
encompassing physical, mental, and emotional health.
When teacher educators experience high levels of
general wellbeing, they are better equipped to fulfill
their professional responsibilities, engage with
students effectively, and foster a positive learning
environment. On the contrary, neglecting general
wellbeing can lead to burnout, decreased job
satisfaction, and diminished performance.
This article aims to explore the significant impact of
general wellbeing on teacher educators' performance
and the implications for the education system. By
examining the interplay between personal wellbeing
and professional effectiveness, we can uncover
strategies to nurture effective and resilient educators.
Throughout this article, we will delve into the various
aspects of general wellbeing that influence teacher
educators' performance. This includes physical health,
mental and emotional wellbeing, work-life balance,
and self-care practices. We will explore the research
and literature on the subject, highlighting the
connections between general wellbeing and indicators
of performance such as instructional quality, student
engagement, and overall job satisfaction. Moreover,
this article will address the importance of cultivating a
culture of support within educational institutions.
Providing teacher educators with resources, training,
and opportunities for personal and professional
development can contribute to their general wellbeing
and, in turn, enhance their performance.
Furthermore, we will discuss the role of educational
policymakers in recognizing the significance of
general wellbeing among teacher educators. By
prioritizing the wellbeing of educators and
implementing supportive policies, education systems

can create an environment that encourages self-care,
professional growth, and overall job satisfaction. The
impact of general wellbeing on teacher educators'
performance cannot be overstated. Nurturing the
wellbeing of teacher educators is not only beneficial
for their personal fulfillment but also crucial for the
quality of education they provide. By promoting
general wellbeing, educational institutions and
policymakers can cultivate effective and resilient
educators who are better equipped to meet the diverse
needs of students and contribute to the overall
improvement of the education system.
II. CULTIVATING MENTAL AND
EMOTIONAL WELLBEING:
EMPOWERING TEACHER EDUCATORS
FOR SUCCESS
1. The Significance of Physical Health:
Physical health plays a fundamental role in the overall
wellbeing and performance of teacher educators.
Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a balanced
diet, and getting sufficient rest are essential for
sustaining energy levels and promoting optimal
functioning. Prioritizing physical health enables
educators to manage the demands of their profession
effectively, exhibit resilience, and model healthy
behaviors for their students. Educational institutions
can support physical wellbeing by providing access to
wellness programs, encouraging physical activity
breaks, and promoting a healthy work-life balance.
2. Mental and Emotional Wellbeing:
The mental and emotional wellbeing of teacher
educators significantly impacts their performance in
the classroom and beyond. Educators who experience
high levels of stress, anxiety, or burnout may struggle
to effectively engage with students and provide quality
instruction. It is crucial to promote self-care practices
that prioritize mental and emotional health. Strategies
such as mindfulness exercises, stress management
techniques, and access to counseling services can
contribute to the overall mental and emotional
wellbeing of teacher educators. Creating a supportive
work environment that encourages open
communication, collaboration, and peer support can
also play a vital role in nurturing their mental and
emotional wellbeing.
3. Work-Life Balance:
Achieving a healthy work-life balance is essential for
teacher educators to maintain general wellbeing and
sustain long-term professional effectiveness. Striking
a balance between work commitments and personal
life allows educators to recharge, engage in hobbies,
and spend quality time with family and friends.
Educational institutions can support work-life balance
by implementing policies that encourage flexible
working hours, promoting reasonable workloads, and
fostering a culture that values the importance of
personal time outside of work. Encouraging selfreflection and goal-setting can also assist teacher
educators in prioritizing their personal and
professional aspirations.
4. Self-Care Practices:
Self-care practices are vital for nurturing the general
wellbeing of teacher educators. Engaging in activities
that bring joy, relaxation, and fulfillment is crucial for
managing stress and preventing burnout. Educators
should be encouraged to pursue hobbies, engage in
self-reflection, and establish boundaries between work
and personal life. By promoting self-care, educational
institutions can create a supportive environment that
acknowledges the importance of holistic wellbeing
and helps educators sustain their passion and
motivation.
5. The Role of Educational Institutions and
Policymakers:
Educational institutions and policymakers have a
critical role to play in nurturing effective and resilient
teacher educators. They can prioritize the wellbeing of
educators by providing resources and professional
development opportunities that support general
wellbeing. This includes wellness programs, mental
health support services, training in stress management
techniques, and promoting a positive and supportive
work culture. Additionally, policies that address worklife balance, workload management, and recognition
of educators' efforts can contribute to their overall job
satisfaction and performance.
The impact of general wellbeing on the performance
of teacher educators cannot be underestimated.
Fostering general wellbeing, including physical
health, mental and emotional wellbeing, work-life
balance, and self-care practices, is essential for

IRE 1704665 ICONIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING JOURNALS 447
nurturing effective and resilient educators. By
prioritizing educators' wellbeing and providing
supportive environments, educational institutions and
policymakers can create a sustainable and positive
work environment that contributes to the overall
quality of education and the success of both educators
and students.
III. SELF-CARE PRACTICES: NURTURING
WELLBEING AND PREVENTING
BURNOUT
Self-care practices play a crucial role in nurturing the
wellbeing of teacher educators and preventing
burnout. The demands and responsibilities of the
teaching profession can be overwhelming, often
leaving educators feeling drained and depleted.
However, by prioritizing self-care, educators can
cultivate a sense of balance, rejuvenation, and
resilience. Engaging in self-care activities is not a
luxury but a necessity for sustaining wellbeing and
preventing burnout. It involves intentionally setting
aside time for activities that promote relaxation, joy,
and personal fulfillment. This may include hobbies,
exercise, mindfulness practices, spending time with
loved ones, or simply engaging in activities that bring
a sense of peace and rejuvenation. Establishing
healthy boundaries between work and personal life is
an essential aspect of self-care. It involves recognizing
the importance of rest, downtime, and engaging in
activities unrelated to work. Educators need to carve
out time for themselves, both during the workday and
outside of it, to recharge and replenish their energy.
Self-reflection is another integral part of self-care.
Taking time to reflect on one's emotions, thoughts, and
overall wellbeing allows educators to gain insight into
their needs and make necessary adjustments. It
involves checking in with oneself regularly and being
attuned to signs of stress or burnout. By being selfaware, educators can proactively address their needs
and seek support when necessary. Moreover,
establishing a support system is crucial for effective
self-care. Collaborating with colleagues, engaging in
meaningful conversations, and seeking emotional
support from others in the profession can provide a
sense of community and validation. Sharing
experiences, challenges, and successes can not only
foster a supportive environment but also provide
insights and strategies for managing stress and
enhancing wellbeing.
Educational institutions play a vital role in promoting
self-care practices among teacher educators. They can
provide resources, training, and workshops that
highlight the importance of self-care and offer
practical strategies for implementation. Creating a
culture that values and supports self-care allows
educators to feel empowered and validated in
prioritizing their own wellbeing. By prioritizing selfcare practices, teacher educators can enhance their
overall wellbeing, prevent burnout, and improve their
performance in the classroom. Taking care of oneself
not only benefits the individual educator but also has
a positive ripple effect on students and the educational
community as a whole. It enables educators to show
up as their best selves, bring enthusiasm and energy
into the classroom, and create a supportive and
nurturing learning environment. Self-care practices
are essential for nurturing the wellbeing of teacher
educators and preventing burnout. By incorporating
self-care into their daily lives, educators can sustain
their passion, energy, and effectiveness in the
profession. Through intentional self-reflection, setting
healthy boundaries, establishing a support system, and
accessing resources provided by educational
institutions, teacher educators can prioritize their
wellbeing and contribute to a positive and sustainable
teaching environment.
IV. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND
WELLBEING: TRAINING AND SUPPORT
FOR EDUCATORS
Professional development plays a crucial role in
enhancing the wellbeing of educators and promoting
their overall effectiveness. By providing training and
support, educational institutions can empower
educators to navigate the challenges of their
profession, develop new skills, and foster a sense of
professional fulfillment. Professional development
programs that prioritize educator wellbeing offer a
unique opportunity for growth and self-improvement.
These programs can encompass a wide range of topics,
including stress management, work-life balance, selfcare practices, and resilience building. By equipping
educators with the tools and strategies to manage their
wellbeing, professional development programs help
© JUN 2023 | IRE Journals | Volume 6 Issue 12 | ISSN: 2456-8880
IRE 1704665 ICONIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING JOURNALS 448
them cultivate a sense of empowerment and control
over their professional lives. Training sessions and
workshops focused on stress management and selfcare are particularly valuable for educators. These
programs provide educators with practical techniques
to effectively cope with the demands of their
profession, such as mindfulness exercises, relaxation
techniques, and time management strategies. By
learning how to manage stress, educators can enhance
their wellbeing, prevent burnout, and maintain their
enthusiasm and passion for teaching.
Additionally, professional development programs can
address work-life balance, recognizing the importance
of maintaining personal lives and pursuing interests
outside of work. Educators can benefit from learning
strategies to effectively manage their time, set
boundaries, and prioritize their personal wellbeing. By
striking a balance between work commitments and
personal life, educators can avoid the pitfalls of
excessive workloads and chronic stress, leading to
increased job satisfaction and overall wellbeing.
Support is another essential component of professional
development for educator wellbeing. Educational
institutions can provide mentorship programs,
coaching sessions, or peer support networks to create
a sense of community and foster collegial
relationships. These support systems offer
opportunities for educators to share experiences, seek
guidance, and gain insights from their peers. Feeling
supported and connected to a network of fellow
educators can significantly contribute to their sense of
wellbeing and job satisfaction.
Furthermore, integrating wellbeing into the fabric of
professional development is crucial for ensuring longterm success. This can involve embedding wellbeingfocused topics throughout the curriculum,
encouraging ongoing reflection and goal-setting, and
providing resources for self-assessment and self-care.
By making wellbeing an integral part of professional
development, educational institutions demonstrate a
commitment to supporting educators' overall growth
and fulfillment. Professional development programs
that prioritize educator wellbeing are essential for
nurturing their growth, effectiveness, and job
satisfaction. By offering training and support in areas
such as stress management, work-life balance, and
self-care, educational institutions empower educators
to navigate the challenges of their profession and
maintain their wellbeing. When educators are
equipped with the necessary skills and strategies to
prioritize their own wellbeing, they can create positive
learning environments and foster the success of their
students.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the impact of general wellbeing on the
performance of teacher educators is undeniable.
Nurturing the wellbeing of educators is not only
crucial for their personal satisfaction and fulfillment
but also directly impacts their effectiveness in the
classroom and beyond. By prioritizing general
wellbeing, including physical health, mental and
emotional wellbeing, work-life balance, and self-care
practices, educational institutions can create a
supportive and empowering environment for teacher
educators. Addressing physical health through regular
exercise, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest allows
educators to sustain their energy levels, exhibit
resilience, and serve as role models for their students.
Prioritizing mental and emotional wellbeing enables
educators to effectively engage with students, provide
quality instruction, and manage stress and anxiety.
Achieving work-life balance allows educators to
recharge, engage in personal pursuits, and maintain a
sense of fulfillment outside of their professional
responsibilities.
Self-care practices play a vital role in nurturing the
overall wellbeing of teacher educators. Engaging in
activities that bring joy, relaxation, and personal
fulfillment helps educators manage stress, prevent
burnout, and sustain their passion and motivation.
Creating supportive environments within educational
institutions, fostering a culture of collaboration and
open communication, and providing resources and
professional development opportunities contribute to
the wellbeing of teacher educators. Educational
institutions and policymakers have a significant
responsibility in promoting general wellbeing among
teacher educators. By providing resources, training,
and support, they can empower educators to prioritize
their wellbeing and effectively manage the demands of
their profession. Policies that address work-life
balance, workload management, and recognition of

IRE 1704665 ICONIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING JOURNALS 449
educators' efforts are essential for creating a
sustainable and positive work environment.
Nurturing effective and resilient teacher educators not
only benefits the educators themselves but also has a
profound impact on the success and wellbeing of their
students. When educators are supported in their
general wellbeing, they can bring their best selves into
the classroom, create a positive and nurturing learning
environment, and inspire their students to thrive
academically and emotionally. In summary,
prioritizing the general wellbeing of teacher educators
is a key factor in nurturing their effectiveness and
resilience. By recognizing the significance of physical
health, mental and emotional wellbeing, work-life
balance, and self-care practices, educational
institutions can create an environment that supports
the holistic wellbeing of educators. Investing in the
wellbeing of teacher educators is an investment in the
success of both educators and students, ultimately
contributing to the overall quality of education.

Abstract
Objectives
The main effects of 8-week mindfulness-based programs (MBP) on anxiety and depression are now supported by reasonably robust evidence. However, few to no studies have looked at whether and how these main effects come to be over the course of the MBP. The goal of the present study was to look at how meditation practice predicted changes in well-being, and vice versa, at a weekly level, within an 8-week online MBP.
Methods
The participants were 457 Finnish upper secondary education students who underwent an 8-week online MBP. App-based ecological momentary assessment data were collected on how many minutes the participants meditated (daily) and their anxiety, happiness, and sleep problems (weekly). These data were analyzed using a longitudinal (nine time point) path model.
Results
Participants’ weekly minutes of mindfulness meditation were a consistent, albeit weak, predictor of decreases in anxiety and increases in happiness. During the course of the study, answer rates declined from 75.7% (Time 0) to 27.4% (Time 8) for anxiety, happiness, and sleep and from 80.5% to 37.0% for meditation minutes.
Conclusions
Results suggest well-being improvement from mindfulness meditation is an ongoing process and that ecological momentary assessment is a promising methodology for studying it.

An accumulating evidence base now points to mindfulness meditation having beneficial effects on, at least, anxiety and depression (Creswell 2017; Goyal et al. 2014; de Vibe et al. 2017). On the other hand, the research community has seen recent voicing of concern over “mindfulness hype” getting ahead of the science (Van Dam et al. 2018; Davidson and Dahl 2018). Though the field sees hundreds of new studies each year, it is still lacking in large sample studies that shed light on more nuanced mechanisms of mindfulness meditation and its impact on well-being or adversity.
Mindfulness is an umbrella term that lacks an all-encompassing definition (Van Dam et al. 2018). However, the most commonly offered definitions include paying attention to present moment experience with an attitude of curiosity and acceptance (e.g., Bishop et al. 2004; we use this definition). A common way to begin mindfulness practice is with “concentration” meditation, i.e., focusing attention on a given object and returning attention to the object when the mind wanders. Another often taught form of practice is open awareness meditation, where attention is allowed to encompass any object in consciousness. Many varieties of meditation exist, depending on, e.g., what attention is focused on, how intensely, and whether the focus moves (for instance from body part to body part) or is fixed (Van Dam et al. 2018). In some meditation practices, a particular positive state is cultivated through visualization and mantra practice—this is common in loving-kindness and compassion practice. The temporal variation of meditation practice can range anywhere from the briefest (a minute, for instance) to intensive silent retreats of weeks, months, or even years.
Mindfulness meditation practice is often learned in mindfulness-based programs (MBPs). The most rigorously standardized and studied examples are mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBSR and MBCT; Kabat-Zinn 1990; Teasdale et al. 2000). These MBPs have mostly shown to benefit participants by alleviating or preventing depression (d = 0.30, p = 0.05) and anxiety (d = 0.38, p < 0.05; Goyal et al. 2014; Kuyken et al. 2015). For adolescents and children, sparser meta-analytic evidence has pointed to comparable effects from undergoing MBPs (Dunning et al. 2018). The amount MBP participants practice appears to be related to the magnitude of benefit derived from practice (Parsons et al. 2017). Thus far, there appears to be little research on which kinds of MBP participants adhere to the practice and which drop out, though this question is essential in designing MBPs that present participants with minimal barriers to entry and support for sustained practice. Adhering to a meditation practice routine can require effort from the participant, so it is possible that participants with higher well-being levels would be less likely to drop out. On the other hand, participants with less well-being might feel more motivated to improve their situation.
Recently, mobile technology has offered a highly scalable medium through which mindfulness can be taught. Meditation apps like Headspace and Waking Up now cater to tens of millions of smartphone users (Harris 2018; Pierson and Puddicombe 2012). App-based meditation courses and other online MBPs have been studied to a lesser extent, but meta-analysis indicates the benefits could be slightly smaller but comparable with those from face-to-face MBPs (Spijkerman et al. 2016).
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a methodology through which real-time reports are collected from participants, usually via smartphone apps. This technology was harnessed by Killingsworth and Gilbert (2010), when they found, using ongoing experience sampling, that the study participants’ minds wandered about 50% of the time and they were less happy when this happened. Jazaieri et al. (2016) used similar methodology to study how participants’ minds wandered during a 9-week compassion meditation course.
Hill and Updegraff (2012; n = 96) used EMA to assess the relationship between mindfulness and emotion regulation in young adults. Another study tracked participants’ anxiety, depression, and mindfulness levels during an MBSR course (Moore et al. 2016; n = 67). The study also compared the EMA assessments, and found them superior, to traditional pen and paper assessments. Another (pilot) study used EMA to study whether mindfulness meditation can be used to reduce smoking over time (Ruscio et al. 2015; n = 44; the group also published two other studies based on related data). Overall, as in the Ruscio et al study, a key application for EMA technology has been tobacco and substance abuse studies, where immediate access to participants’ experience yields more reliable information on craving, mood, and other factors related to relapse (e.g., Shiffman et al. 2002; for an EMA overview, see Shiffman et al. 2008).
MBP main effects on, e.g., anxiety and depression are becoming well known. Less is known about exactly how practicing meditation during an MBP causes well-being to improve and how improved well-being affects the meditation practice. For example, is a week’s practice predictive of less anxiety in the next week, and is less anxiety predictive of more future practice? These kinds of questions are well suited for week-by-week EMA targeting.
Of interest is also how varying quantities of meditation practice during an MBP affect participants’ well-being gains from the practice. Thus far, this topic has mostly been investigated via pre- and post-MBP measurements—a somewhat crude metric for what could be a nuanced process over many weeks. If a study only obtains retrospective practice frequency data at the post-MBP measurement, it is susceptible to recall bias and risks being less reliable (Kahneman and Riis 2005). Daily or weekly EMA reports from participants offer a clearer window into what participants actually experience and do during the multi-week courses.
In the present study, we harnessed daily and weekly app-based EMA to assess whether engaging in meditation practice at different stages of an 8-week online MBP would result in immediate benefit. Our aims were (1) to investigate the direction of possible causal effects between meditation practice and well-being (operationalized as anxiety, sleep problems, and happiness) and (2) to examine which baseline characteristics of participants would predict developing and sticking to a practice routine and which characteristics would make a participant more likely to drop out. Our hypotheses were that (1) practicing meditation would result in well-being gains and (2) the more participants practiced, the more they would benefit.
Method
Participants
Participants (n = 457) were upper secondary education students and represented all of Finland geographically. Median age for participants was 17 (ranging from 15 to 24+), 88.0% of participants were female (358 females, 43 males, 6 identified as “other”), and 80.6% went to upper secondary school (328 upper secondary school, 79 vocational institute). Participants volunteered to take part in the online Tita MBP and the study in response to nationwide recruitment emails to all Finnish upper secondary education institutions (approximate n = 554), describing the program and (evidence-based) benefits of mindfulness meditation.
Procedure
We instructed the participants to download an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) app Paco (Google Commerce Ltd. 2014). Out of 717 eligible students, the sample of the present study (457 students; 63.7% of all) were the students who downloaded the app and answered at least one daily (“how many minutes did you practice yesterday”) question or at least one weekly (anxiety, sleep problems, happiness) questionnaire.
The MBP
The website-based online MBP, Tita, comprises 7 guided meditations (sitting meditation for 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min; body scan for 20 min, walking meditation, self-compassion for 5 min, and loving-kindness for 12 min) and 9 lectures (10–20 min each) with topics ranging from what mindfulness is, through the relationship between thoughts, emotions, and the body to compassion and dealing with stress. Participants were presented a new lecture on each Sunday during 8 weeks. The lectures gradually introduced new meditation practices throughout the course. However, participants were also able to access any guided meditation (including the ones that had not been introduced yet) any time they wanted to, as we wanted to maximize their opportunity to practice on their own. The MBP did not include prompts to practice.
Data collection
Participants were asked questions via the Paco app daily (number of minutes practiced yesterday; question prompt at 9 a.m.) and weekly (anxiety scale (GAD-7), happiness item, and sleep problems item). Baseline measurement (T0) was on the day they gained access to the program. The daily questions were asked on 56 days (2 October 2017 to 26 November 2017) and the weekly questions on 9 Sundays (T0: 1 October 2017, T8: 26 November 2017). To maximize the participant response rate, the weekly questionnaire was designed to be as light as possible while attempting to maximize the extent to which it operationalizes well-being.
Measures
Anxiety
Anxiety was measured with the brief generalized anxiety measure, the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al. 2006). GAD-7 comprises seven items asking about respondent anxiety over the last two weeks (e.g., asking respondents how often they have been bothered by “Not being able to stop or control worrying”), each with four answer options ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores for GAD-7 range from 0 to 21. Cronbach’s α = 0.86.
Happiness
Happiness was measured with a global item adapted from the UN World Happiness Report: “Overall, how good do you consider your life, that is, the quality of your life, to have been during the last week?” (Helliwell et al. 2018). Options were in numerical form and ranged from 0 (“the worst possible quality of life”) to 10 (“the best possible quality of life”).
Sleep problems
Sleep problems were measured with a global item “How well do you feel you slept last week?” with five options: 1 = well, 2 = somewhat well, 3 = not well, not poorly, 4 = somewhat poorly, 5 = poorly. The item was an adaptation from Partinen & Gislason (Finnish version of the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ-FIN); Partinen and Gislason 1995).
Meditation minutes
Each day, for 56 days, participants were asked to enter the number of minutes they practiced meditation yesterday. They would then type in, e.g., “10” or “0” (entries ranged from 0 to 90 min). Meditation minutes were summed up to form weekly aggregates for each span between time points from T0–T1 to T7–T8 (missing answers were equated to zero minutes).
Data analyses
First, we looked at correlations between and descriptives of study variables at baseline (T0). We then compared the baseline characteristics and total meditation minutes of (1) boys and girls, (2) upper secondary school and vocational institute students, and (3) completers and dropouts using independent samples T tests. We evaluated whether benefit from the MBP (T8 anxiety, happiness, and sleep problems while controlling for gender and school type) could be predicted from total meditation minutes. We also examined whether total meditation minutes could be predicted from baseline characteristics. We then calculated percentage-changes for main outcomes for comparison to ones obtained in our previous study. We also looked at correlations between T8–T0 difference scores and baselines for indication of what types of participants benefited most.
We then formed a path model with nine time points, encompassing all measurements for anxiety, happiness, sleep problems, and meditation minutes (Fig. 1). In the model, the outcome at Tk was auto-regressed on the outcome at Tk−1. The sum of meditation minutes for each week (i.e., meditation minutes between Tk−1 and Tk) was also auto-regressed on meditation minutes from the previous week (between Tk−2 and Tk−1). In addition, meditation minutes between Tk−1 and Tk were regressed on each outcome at Tk−1 and, conversely, each outcome at Tk was regressed on meditation minutes between Tk−1 and Tk. Gender and school type were initially controlled for but, as they had little effect on the results, were left out of the final model for the sake of parsimony. All variables were standardized for the path analyses. Analyses were run in Mplus 8.1 (Muthén and Muthén 1998-2017). Missing values were handled via the full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) mechanism built in the Mplus software. As our sample size was on the larger side for most time points and the model complex, power analyses were not run.

Attrition
Both the daily and weekly EMA response rates declined during the 8-week duration of the MBP. At T0 the respondents/missing ratio for the weekly survey (measuring anxiety, happiness, and sleep problems) was 346/457. The attrition pattern for the weekly survey (as for the aggregate weekly meditation minutes) is presented in Table 1. For the daily meditation minutes question, there were 182 answers on day 1, 207 on day 2, 220 on day 3, and then slowly decreasing over the 56-day span to bottom out at 74 answers on day 56. On the weekly meditation minutes aggregates, 368 people answered at least once during week 1 (T0–T1). It is important to note that attrition here only pertains to subjects who stopped answering EMA prompts and does not mean they dropped out of the MBP altogether.

Results
The outcome variables (anxiety, happiness, and sleep problems) were moderately to strongly intercorrelated. Anxiety was negatively correlated with happiness (r = − 0.49) and positively correlated with sleep problems (r = 0.37). Happiness was negatively correlated with sleep problems (r = − 0.32). Out of 56 possible days, participants reported meditation practice (or lack of it), on average, on 17 days (ranging from 1 to 55 days; Table 3). Average total meditation time reported during the MBP was 138.5 min (ranging from 0 to 1068 min, or 17.8 h).
There were no statistically significant differences in study variables at T0 between boys and girls or upper secondary school students and vocational institute students (t < 1.7, p > 0.10; Table 2). The single statistically significant difference in study variables at T0 between dropouts and completers was that completers reported substantially more meditation minutes than dropouts (t = 22.92, p < 0.01). We defined dropout as not responding at week 7 or later. As most attrition occurred in the final week of the program, a cutoff at week 7 was deemed more informative than week 8, because, using the latter criterion, the majority of participants would have been classed as dropouts. Dropout could not be predicted by regressing it on baseline values of the outcome variables (betas <  0.05, p > 0.10). Also, total meditation minutes were not a statistically significant predictor of anxiety, happiness, or sleep problems at T8, when controlling for gender, school type, and the baseline value for the T8 outcome variable under investigation. For every day of the study period, the mode for reported meditation practice was 5 min (followed by 10 min), with daily means ranging from 6.86 to 10.86 min. Finally, baseline anxiety, happiness, or sleep problems were not statistically significant predictors of meditation minutes, when controlling for gender and school type.

Between T0 (n = 346) and T8 (n = 125), sample anxiety decreased from 8.05 to 4.85 (39.7%), happiness increased from 6.82 to 7.62 (11.7%), and sleep problems decreased from 1.81 to 1.19 (34.3%; Table 3). Benefit from the MBP (measured as T8 − T0 difference scores) was associated with lower baseline anxiety (r = − 0.54), higher happiness level (r = 0.14) and less sleep problems (r = − 0.12).

After evaluating initial model fit for an unmodified model (root mean square error for approximation, i.e., RMSEA 0.06; comparative fit index, i.e., CFI 0.81), 24 additional autoregressions were added based on standardized expected parameter change (SEPC) values, after determining their adding was in alignment with the theory-driven model. RMSEA for the final model was 0.04, indicating good fit (MacCallum et al. 1996), whereas CFI for the model was 0.91, indicating acceptable fit (Hu and Bentler (1999) recommend “close to 0.95” as a cutoff; other model fit indices: SRMR = 0.14; χ2 (p < 0.05) = 862.95). Since many meditation minutes variables were skewed (> 2) and had high kurtosis (> 2; Garson 2012), we used robust maximum likelihood estimation.
All but one of the autoregressions were statistically significant (p < 0.05; Table 4). Seven out of eight anxiety measurements regressed on meditation minutes from the past week had a negative sign indicating a possible predictive effect of meditation on anxiety was likely to be inverse. One of these coefficients (M0–M1 → A1) was statistically significant.

All happiness variables regressed on meditation minutes had a positive sign, indicating a possible predictive effect of meditation on happiness. Two of these regression coefficients (M1–M2 → H2 and M6–M7 → H7) were statistically significant. Seven out of eight sleep problems measurements regressed on meditation minutes had a negative sign. None of these coefficients was statistically significant. Six out of eight meditation variables regressed on sleep problems in the previous week were negative. All regressions added based on SEPC were also statistically significant.
Discussion
The present study set out to investigate how practicing mindfulness meditation during an 8-week online MBP would affect participants’ well-being in real time. Conversely, we looked at how well-being (or lack of it) would affect participants’ meditation practice during the MBP. We also investigated what baseline characteristics of participants would predict continuing to practice or dropping out. The results indicate meditation practice during a given week in the program weakly predicted improvements in the well-being outcomes, though only three of these relationships were statistically significant (M0–M1 → A1, M1–M2 → H2, and M6–M7 → H7). This is likely partly due to attrition and smaller sample sizes in later stages of the MBP, resulting in lower power for later time point regression coefficients.
Conversely, the results indicate prior well-being (or adversity) did not have a statistically significant effect on how much participants practiced meditation during a given week, though results regarding sleep problems trended in this direction. Also, in the weeks when participants benefitted the most from practice, there were not corresponding boosts to practice more (e.g., M6–M7 → A7 was statistically significant but A7 → M7–M8 was not). Baseline differences of participants were not found to be predictive of continuing to practice or dropping out. Overall, the study provided a look at whether well-being (or adversity) during the course of the MBP may be in bidirectional causal relations with the meditation practice. Our results provide some evidence benefit from MBPs is likely an ongoing process fed by a sustained meditation practice.
Completing the 8-week MBP and answering the ecological momentary assessment questions resulted in some benefit in terms of outcome effects. Participants that answered the T8 EMA query experienced an average reduction in their GAD-7 scores from 8.05 to 4.85, suggesting answering daily or weekly prompts, asking about the participants’ mood and whether they meditated, could result in a positive effect of its own. This 3.2-point reduction is less than the 5-point cutoff for “reliable improvement” on the GAD-7 (Richards and Borglin 2011). Our sample was subclinical and it is possible there is a floor effect for how much the participants are likely to improve. Out of the 23 participants scoring above the clinical threshold of 10 in anxiety and answering both T0 and T8 anxiety surveys (n = 92), 17 (73.9%) experienced a clinically significant reduction in their anxiety (from above 10 to below 9; Richards and Borglin 2011). It is possible participants who feel better are more motivated to answer questions, but as completers and dropouts did not differ in baseline characteristics in this study, it is unlikely this is a major cause for the effect. Taken together, our results give some evidence that clinically significant improvement in anxiety may be obtained by taking part in an online MBP, provided the participant adheres to the program.
The beneficial effect was immediate, as there was a marked decrease in anxiety and sleep problems and an increase in happiness in the first weeks of the program. In MBP studies that only use pre- and post-measurements, it is hard to know whether salutary effects occur in the beginning, in the middle, in the end, or throughout the course of the MBP. Amount of practice was not a major contributor to benefit in our data which is contrary to what other studies have found (Carmody and Baer 2008; Huppert and Johnson 2010; Parsons et al. 2017). This may partly be due to participants reporting relatively few meditation minutes overall. A dose-response effect may only arise once a threshold is surpassed in terms of practice time. Early stages of meditation practice are particularly effortful (Tang et al. 2012) and it may well be that benefit from practice starts to differentiate meditators only after they have cleared initial stages of practice.
The average total meditation minutes the participants reported in our study amounted to less than 2.5 h, but the average MBSR/MBCT participant engages in 3 h of practice per week (Parsons et al. 2017). This disparity in amounts of practice could be at least partly due to (1) the most commonly used Tita meditation being only 5 min in length and (2) our sample consisting mostly of adolescents, as they may still be in the process of developing the self-discipline and motivation a sustained practice requires.
Given there have thus far been few mindfulness studies employing ecological momentary assessment methodology, the present study can be seen as a contribution to the field in a number of ways (see, e.g., Hill and Updegraff 2012; Moore et al. 2016; Ruscio et al. 2015). First, to our knowledge, it is the first of its kind to take a series of concurrent, within MBP measurements of how dosage (how much participants meditate) affects effect (well-being benefit) and vice versa. Second, with 457 participants, the study has a larger than usual sample size in the field (compare with n = 96 in Hill and Updegraff (2012), n = 67 in Moore et al. (2016), and n = 44 in Ruscio et al. (2015))—even with attrition in the later weeks of the MBP. Third, the sample consisted of volunteers from all over Finland and can be considered an ecologically valid look at who volunteers for online MBPs for upper secondary education students in Finland. Finally, our tentative finding that participants who answer EMA prompts may improve over and above regular MBP participants can also be seen as potentially useful in improving MBP designs.
Limitations and future research
Some limitations of the study should be noted. First, the EMA data were collected only from the MBP group, as part of an efficacy study, and there are no equivalent data from the waitlist control group. The rationale for this decision was that our previous study already resolved how the MBP impacted participants when compared with waitlist controls and, in the present study, we only intended to look at how the MBP achieved its effects.
Second, even though we went to some lengths to minimize attrition (participants were contacted with newsletters multiple times during the efficacy study—in addition to the Paco prompts they were already receiving daily), the dwindling sample size still presented some problems for the analyses. Even with full-information maximum likelihood analyses in Mplus allowing us to take full advantage of all gathered data, the sample size was inconveniently small in the later weeks of the study period. However, as the sample size stayed above 200 for nearly all time points and as statistically or marginally statistically significant findings appeared in the later weeks (where power is lower), the model should be adequately powered overall. Also, because of attrition in the meditation minutes data, it is hard to know how well the totals reflect the actual meditation minutes totals (including possible practice participants failed to report). Possible reasons for the EMA attrition are (1) some participants quitting the MBP altogether and consequently ceasing to answer EMA prompts and (2) finding answering the daily/weekly prompts tiresome or demanding and ceasing to answer while continuing with the MBP.
Third, the volunteer sample skewed strongly towards female and upper secondary school. This was an unavoidable consequence of obtaining an ecologically valid sample based on accepting the people that wanted to be included. It appears that using mindfulness to increase well-being currently appeals to adolescent females more than to males. Mainstream conceptions of mindfulness (as having to do with yoga or self-care, for instance) in Finland may well account for the discrepancy. We could have attempted to balance gender and school type, but this would have led to having a much smaller sample size. There were no statistically significant baseline differences in study outcome variables based on gender or school type. However, because the sample consisted of volunteers, a selection bias may have resulted, for example, in overrepresentation of anxious or depressed students or students with a favorable idea of mindfulness. Students higher in baseline well-being reported more benefit from the MBP and this was not due to them practicing more. However, they may have had a better than average ability to learn from the practice they did.
Fourth, our use of single item measures (happiness and sleep problems) was methodologically suboptimal, though justified by the need to keep the weekly questionnaires minimally demanding for the participants. Lengthier scales could be used in the future to see whether this creates more missing data or not.
Fifth, as effects were statistically significant for only some time points, they are to be taken as weak evidence for causal relations between meditation minutes and well-being. Stronger confirming or disconfirming evidence can be obtained in future studies.
For future directions, researchers could take note of the positive aspects of employing (1) online MBPs and (2) EMA technology to study these MBPs. It has never been easier and less costly to obtain large samples on MBPs, which should then facilitate devising many kinds of novel study designs and foci. Large sample size data sets make it possible, e.g., to study individual differences of MBP participants in a way face-to-face MBP studies lack the power to do (Davidson and Dahl 2018). Online MBPs are highly scalable and, if beneficial, as early evidence indicates (Spijkerman et al. 2016), can expand MBP reach and resulting benefits to new populations. EMA technology makes it easier to study specific components of programs and to obtain real-time data on their effects. Specifically, future research could (1) adopt the EMA technology to obtain practice and outcome data during face-to-face MBPs and (2) build an evidence-base around a promising online MBP (similar to what has been done with MBSR/MBCT in face-to-face MBP research). The research community would do well to embrace this methodology and come up with innovative applications for it in the study of mindfulness and MBPs.
