In-season training load quantification of one-, two- and three-game week schedules in a top European professional soccer team

Abstract
Top European soccer teams that play in UEFA competitions often participate in one, two- or three-games per week. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure optimal match-day performance and full recovery. The aim of this study was to quantify internal and external training load (TL) within five microcycles: M1 and M2 กV one-game weeks; M3 and M4 กV two-game weeks; M5 กV three-game week). Thirteen elite soccer players participated in this study. A?global positioning system?(GPS) was used to measure the total distance covered and distances of different exercise training zones (1กV5), the session ratings of perceived exertion (s-RPE) scores and the amount of?creatine kinase?(CK) created during daily training sessions for the 2015กV2016 in-season period. The data were analysed with respect to the number of days prior to a given match. The main results indicate that there was a significant difference in training intensity for zone 1 between M2 and M4 (4010.2?กำ?103.5 and 4507.6?กำ?133.0?m, respectively); a significant difference in training intensity for zone 3 between M1 and M5 (686.1?กำ?42.8 and 801.2?กำ?61.2?m, respectively); a significant difference in the duration of the training sessions and matches between M2 and M5 (69.2?กำ?2.1 and 79.6?กำ?2.3) and M3 and M5 (69.7?กำ?1.0 and 79.6?กำ?2.3); and finally, there was a significant difference in CK between M3 and M2 (325.5?กำ?155.0 and 194.4?กำ?48.9). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in TL in the last day prior to a match, for all microcycles and all variables. There was no significant difference with respect to s-RPE. This study provides the first report of daily external and internal TLs and weekly accumulated load (training sessions and match demands) during one, two, and three-game week schedules in a group of elite soccer players. Expected significant differences are found in daily and accumulated loads for within- and between-game schedules. A similar pattern is exhibited for one- and two-game week microcycles regarding the day before the match, which exhibits a decrease in all variables. Despite the different number of games played per week, TL remain similar between microcycles for zone 2 and 5, plus s-RPE.

1.?Introduction
Generally, in soccer, games occur once every week. However, teams that play in UEFA competitions and domestic league/cup competitions may participate in more games (two or three) per week [[1],?[2],?[3]]. More games per week, and thus more games per season, can make it difficult for coaches to manage the training load (TL) and avoid accumulated fatigue, while ensuring that players remain at an optimal level of physical fitness. In fact, the inappropriate management of TL has quickly become one of the main risk factors in non-contact injuries [[4],?[5]] or increased levels of fatigue, as well as higher risk of illness [5]. Quantifying and comparing the TL experienced during microcycles with different number of games could help explain the changes between microcycles (both overall and between player positions) throughout the competitive season. Therefore, it is very important to monitor TL to ensure optimal match-day performance and recovery [6,7] and, consequently, it would be expected a proper training periodization to maximize physiological adaptations and technical/tactical performances. However, the application of classic training periodization is limited for elite European soccer teams due to congestive periods of soccer matches. For instance, elite European players may only participate in 1-2 training sessions between two matches. Consequently, coaches spent some time on recovery training sessions during the in-season. In fact, only recently the scientific community tried to describe the in-season training periodization practices of elite soccer teams in more detail, including a comparison of training days within weekly microcycles [[2],?[8],?[9]].
Training load includes both external and internal loads. External TL is associated with the physical work performed during a training session or match (e.g., distances covered at different speeds), while internal TL is related to biochemical (psychological and physiological, e.g., rating of perceived exertion กV RPE) and biochemical stress responses (e.g., creatine kinase) [[10],?[11]]. By the 1970s, soccer teams were limited to the use of subjective scales to monitor TL such RPE initially developed by Borg [12], and later adapted by Foster in the spelling words of the scale [13]. Another simple, time-efficient and cost-effective method of assessing TL is to multiply the total exercise duration (in minutes) by RPE (using an adapted Borg [12]) also known as the session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) devised by Foster [[13],?[14],?[15]] and Impellizzeri [16]. In recent years, this method has incorporated the use of heart-rate (HR) telemetry systems, which include semi-automated multi-camera systems, local positioning systems and?global positioning systems?(GPS) with accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, barometer. Biochemical markers have also been used to analyse the impact of internal TL. One of the most commonly used markers is Creatine Kinase (CK). Indeed, CK is widely considered to be a marker of fatigue status [[17],?[18]] and skeletal muscle fibre damage [19]. Thus, CK should be considered and analysed in addition to other TL values to amplify results [20].
Several studies have examined the soccer in-season phase, which includes short training microcycles of 1กV2?weeks for top-level and elite junior players [[21],?[22]], mesocycles of 4กV10?weeks for young [16] and elite players [[23],?[24]] and longer training blocks of 3กV4?months for professional players [25]. Manzi et al. [26] have attempted to quantify TL throughout the pre-season and Jeong et al. [27] have conducted a comparison of TL during the pre-season and the in-season, both for professional players. However, the majority of these studies only provide limited information about TL, since they only consider the duration and session of RPE and do not include any GPS data. In addition, few studies among elite soccer players [[26],?[27],?[28]] have attempted to quantify TL with respect to changes between mesocycles and microcycles (both overall and between player's positions) across a full competitive season. None of the studies have analysed and compared internal and external TL simultaneously across microcycles with 1-, 2- and 3-game week during the competitive soccer phase.
Furthermore, the physical demands of training on elite professional soccer players are not currently well documented and are limited to reports of a single week exposure [29]. However, elite soccer players often play two (e.g. Sunday-to-Saturday) or three (e.g. Sunday-Wednesday-Saturday) games over a seven-day period. This is largely due to involvement in numerous competitions (i.e. domestic league/cup competitions and UEFA competitions) and periods of intense schedules, such as in the winter [3]. Periodized or tapering approaches, which means a decrease in TL until the match, were reported within the literature have attempted to facilitate a progressive TL [30] or reduce the risk of injury [31]. Only recently sports scientists have begun to describe the in-season training periodization practices of elite soccer teams in more detail, including a comparison of training days within weekly micro-cycles [[2],?[8],?[9],?[32]]. Malone et al. [8] have found that only the last training session before a match differs from other training days with regard to duration, total distance, average speed and s-RPE. Moreover, Akenhead et al. [9] have reported a similar decrease in total distance and high-speed running distances (HSRD) for training sessions closer to match-day. Nevertheless, there are limited data regarding the single-week exposure of TL in elite professional soccer players [23]. Therefore, it is important to further examine how TL is managed on days between games for one, two and three game week schedules because weekly training frequency is different. This information could be important for coaches and sports scientists to determine the correct approach [33].
Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify TL and match load for three different weekly game schedules: one-, two- and three-game week, from five different weeks, during the 2015กV2016 season in a sample of elite European soccer players.
2.?Material and methods
2.1.?Participants
Thirteen elite outfield soccer players belonging to a top European team that played in a UEFA Champions league with a mean?กำ?SD age, height and mass of 26.2?กำ?4.1?years, 183.5?กำ?6.1?cm and 78.7?กำ?5.1?kg, respectively, participated in this study. The participating players consisted of two central defenders (CD), two wide defenders (WD), five central midfielders (CM), two wide midfielders (WM) and two strikers (ST). We adapted inclusive criteria from Steven et al. [32] using the records of players who played for at least 60?min on a UEFA Champions league game, or a national league game or a national cup in each of the three-week pattern microcycles. There was a drop-out of 24 players due to the lack of collected data in the chosen weeks. All participants were familiarized with the training protocols prior to investigation. This study was conducted according to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the the institutionกฆs research ethics committee.
2.1.1.?Design
For this longitudinal study, training and match load data were collected over a 39-week period during the 2015กV2016 annual season (July 2015 to May 2016). The team used for data collection competed in four official competitions across the season, including the UEFA Champions league, the national league and two more national cups from their own country, which often meant that the team played one, two or three games per week. For the purposes of the present study, all sessions conducted during the main team sessions were considered. Moreover, all data collected from matches for the period chosen were considered. Only data collected from the training sessions and the matches of players who played for at least a minimum of 60?min on each microcycle, was considered. Data from rehabilitation or recuperation were excluded. The duration of the training sessions includes the warm-up, main and slow-down phases, plus stretching. All training programs were planned by the coach and staff and the researchers only standardized the ?rst 30?min and the ?nal 30?min (i.e. before and after each training session). The familiarization of the subjective scale session-RPE was held during the pre-season period.
The weeks were chosen based on the number of games played (one, two, or three), in addition to the inclusion of four training sessions within the week, following one or two days off for recovery and one or two in-house recovery sessions (Table 1).

Although compensation minutes were included in the collected data, this number is not given because the administration of the soccer club does not want to any information disclosed that could reveal which team was studied.
2.2.?Experimental procedures
Training and match data were collected over the course of five different 7-day periods (microcycles): for one-game week, microcycle M1 against one medium/bottom-level opponent and M2 against one top-level opponent from the national league; for two-game week, microcycle M3 against a top-level opponent from the European Champions league and a medium/bottom-level opponent from the national league, plus microcycle M4 against two medium/bottom-level opponents from two national leagues; for three-game week, microcycle M5 against medium/bottom-level opponents from the national league, national cup league and national league, respectively. Although other weeks also fit the descriptions provided, the five different weeks selected met the criteria for participants, meaning that they completed all training sessions during the chosen weeks and completed at least one game during the timeframe. A total number of 20 training sessions (260 individual) and 9 games (117 individual) were observed for this study. This study did not influence or alter the training sessions in any way. Training and match data were collected at the soccer club's outdoor training pitches. The data were analysed in relation to the day of the weekly microcycle (i.e. day 1, day 2กK and day 7). Moreover, we also included the กงmatch day minusกจ approach used by Malone et al. [27] to increase clarity with regard to the different weekly scenarios.
2.2.1.?External training load กV training data
Each player's?physical activity?during each training session was monitored using a portable GP unit (Viper pod 2, STATSports, Belfast, UK). Research has shown this system to be a valid and reliable marker of assessment for monitoring a team player's movements [34]. This device provides?position?velocity and distance data at 10?Hz. Each unit includes a GPS sensor (10?Hz) which logged coordinates at 1?Hz coupled with three axes of acceleration, which measured up to +/- 8?g, and logged data at 100?Hz. Each player wore the device inside a custom-made vest across the upper back, between the left and right scapula. In this position, the GPS antenna is exposed to allow for clear satellite reception. This type of system has previously been found to provide valid and reliable estimates of instantaneous and constant velocity movements during linear, multidirectional and soccer-specific activities [[35],?[36]]. All devices were activated 30?min before data collection to allow for the acquisition of satellite signals and to ensure that the GPS clock was synchronised with the satellite's atomic clock [37]. Following each training session, GPS data were downloaded using the respective software package (Viper PSA software, STATSports, Belfast, UK) and were cut to only include movements that occurred during the training session (i.e. the beginning of the warm-up to the end of the last organised drill). In order to avoid inter-unit errors, players wore the same GPS device for each training session [[38],?[39]].
Thus, the following variables were selected: total duration of training session, total distance, distance of different exercise intensity zones: zone 1 (0กV10.9?Km/h), zone 2 (11กV13.9?Km/h), zone 3 (14กV18.9?Km /h), zone 4 (19กV23.9?Km/h) and zone 5 (> 24?Km/h). The run-speed threshold categories used are in accordance with the previous studies [[40],?[41]].
2.2.2.?External training load กV match data
Each player's match data were examined using a tracking system (DatatraX?) to provide real-time analysis.
Thus, the following variables were selected: total duration of match, total distance, distance of different exercise intensity zones: zone 1 (0กV10.9 Km/h), zone 2 (11กV13.9 Km/h), zone 3 (14กV18.9 Km /h), zone 4 (19กV23.9 Km/h) and zone 5 (> 24 Km/h).
2.2.3.?Internal training load กV training data
Since the early development of the original Borg scale (Borg [12]) to control rating of perceived exertion (RPE), several adaptations have been developed to allow a better way to control individual exercise intensity, such as, the 10-point scale developed by Foster [13] and the adapted Borg CR10-scale [12]. Despite the differences in the number of points and wording within the scales, all determine an individualกฆs internal response and/or?physiological stress?to an external stimulus and provide information regarding their perceived effort post-training or competition. Thirty minutes after each training session, the players were asked to provide an RPE rating, using the modified CR10-scale by Foster [13]. All players were familiarized with the RPE scale prior to the commencement of the study. Players were prompted to track their RPE individually using a custom-designed application on a portable computer tablet. Each player selected their RPE rating by touching the respective score on the tablet, which was then automatically saved to the player's profile. This method helped minimise factors that could influence a player's RPE rating, such as peer pressure and replicating other players' ratings [42]. Each individual RPE value was multiplied by the session duration to generate a session-RPE (s-RPE) value [[13],?[14],?[15]].
Forty-eight hours before the matches, we measured the concentration of?plasma CK?found in each player [7]. To accomplish this, the skin was first cleaned using a 95% ethyl alcohol. After drying, 32?ฃgL of capillary blood was collected using an automatic lancet. The blood was saved in a heparinized capillary tube (Reflotron Plus, Roche Diagnostics) and immediately pipetted onto a reactive CK strip (Reflotron Plus, Roche Diagnostics), to be placed in a Boehringer Mannheim Reflotron Analyser?.
2.3.?Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using the SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for Windows statistical software package. Initially, descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests were conducted to determine normality and homoscedasticity, respectively. Once variables obtained a?normal distribution?(Shapiro-Wilk?>?.05), it was used a repeated measures ANOVA test and the Bonferroni post-hoc test to determine where the specific differences lay. And to compare variables for each of the seven days of the week. This process was repeated to also allow a comparison between all microcycles/weeks. The results are significant for a p???.05. The effect-size (ES) statistic was calculated to determine the magnitude of effects by standardizing the coefficients according to the appropriate between-subjects standard deviation and was assessed using the following criteria: <0.2?=?trivial, 0.2 to 0.6?=?small effect, 0.6 to 1.2?=?moderate effect, 1.2 to 2.0?=?large effect, and >2.0?=?very large [43].
3.?Results
3.1.?Day-to-day variations in training load across one-, two and three-game weeks
Duration of activity and distance covered within specific speed zones are presented in?Table 2,?Table 3, respectively. In addition to the global indices of training and match load, the main effects (all?p?<?.05) across the 7-day period for distance completed within each speed category were also observed for each week (see?Table 2,?Table 3). To address issues with brevity, pairwise comparisons between specific days are reported in?Table 2,?Table 3?as well. We adopted the same method for data presentation as Anderson et al. [2].

Duration and distance covered for training sessions and matches were rated according to a perceived exertion scale; s-RPE and CK values from the training sessions were compared for all microcycles. There are no differences for total distance, training intensity of zones 2, 4, and 5, s-RPE and RPE,?P?<?.05.
However, there were significant differences between several of the microcycles for some variables (see?Fig. 1,?Fig. 2,?Fig. 3,?Fig. 4,?Fig. 5). For example, there is significant difference in training intensity of zone 1 between M2 and M4 (4010.2?กำ?103.5 vs 4507.6?กำ?133.0?m, respectively, ES 4.17 (2.70, 5.38).

4.?Discussion
The main aim of this study was to determine the TLs of weekly microcycles, in which a different number of matches occur, for a professional male elite soccer team. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report of daily external and internal TL and weekly accumulated load (training sessions and match demands) for one, two, and three-game week schedules in a sample of elite soccer players. This study could find significant differences in daily and accumulated loads for the within- and between-game schedules.
4.1.?Comparison between days of the week-pattern microcycles
In general, the TL is different between training sessions depending on the number of games (one, two, or three) per week.
The internal TL analysed through s-RPE does not seem to have a pattern in the different microcycles. These results contradict previous studies [[2],?[27],?[44]], which have found an intense s-RPE pattern exists in the beginning of the different microcycles.
The s-RPE is a viable method to characterize training responses in players [[13],?[14],?[15],?[45]], however, our results indicate that s-RPE does not follow the same pattern as the external TL variables. Indeed, several studies have stated that RPE may be a physiological and volatile construct that could differ depending on the cognitive focus of a given player [[46],?[47],?[48],?[49]]. Also, Renfree, Martin, Micklewright and Gibson [50] have reported that RPE can be dissociated from the?physiological process?through a variety of psychological mechanisms, such as, many positive/negative game training experiences, confrontations with team-mates/coaches or even some life issues that can interfere in positive/negative way to the given RPE. For this reason, RPE may be an oversimplification of the psychophysiological perceived exertion and a non-conclusive measure to capture a wide range of experienced sensations [[51],?[52],?[53]]. It is also important to note that RPE was collected 30?min after the end of each training session and it would be pertinent to check whether there are any atypical variations during the training sessions, as stated by Ferraz et al. [48]. These arguments may explain why there were no differences in s-RPE between training days, as well as why there appears to be a lack of relationship between s-RPE and the external TL variables.
When s-RPE was analysed in the 1-game week microcycle, there was no significant difference in s-RPE for days 4 and 5 (MD-3 and MD-2, respectively), although there was a slight difference when compared to day 6 (MD-1). Thus, it is likely that days 4 and 5 (MD-3 and MD-2, respectively) were higher loading days, while day 6 (MD-1) was a tapering session for the match. There were no differences in s-RPE between days 3 and 6 (MD-4 and MD-3, respectively), being the first one of recovery and the other of tapering. The load distribution found in this study is similar to that reported in several other studies [[2],?[8],?[32]].
With regard to the 2-game week microcycle (M3 and M4), there were no differences in s-RPE for days 4 and 5 (respectively, MD-3 and MD-2). Days that exhibited higher TL (MD-4) appear to be merely coincidental in our study, although Anderson et al. [2] have reported that MD-3 regularly exhibits higher TL than other days. In the study conducted by Anderson et al. [2], one day-off was given after each match-day, which likely meant that MD-4 was a recovery training session and would therefore, exhibit lower TL.
Singularly, for M5 (for the 3-game week microcycle), the day after the match exhibited greater s-RPE (MD-2, corresponding to days 2 and 5 of the week) but no significant difference was found. Only considering RPE, however, there was a significant difference between MD-2 and MD-1 (corresponding to day 2 and day 3; and day 5 and day 6, respectively). This 3-game week microcycle did not have a single day-off, unlike in the study conducted by Anderson et al. [2], occurring 2 training sessions between matches.
As match-day approaches, external TL (as total distance and distances covered at different running speed thresholds during training) decreases in almost all week-pattern microcycles. Moreover, our results indicate that external TL is highest at the beginning of the microcycle: this is likely done to ensure that fatigue is minimal as match-day nears. Several studies have stressed the importance of varying daily TLs (i.e. alternation of low- and heavy-load training days) to achieve optimal performance on match-day [[2],?[8],?[24]]. Stevens et al. [32] have reported the highest external TL on the first training-day of the week. Akenhead et al. [9] have found that, for an entire season, the highest external TL typically occurs on the second training-day of the 1-game week. Also, Anderson et al. [2] have reported highest external TL on the second for 1- and 2-game week. The findings of Malone et al. [8] indicate no differences in external TL between the first three training-days of the week, but their study analyzed a 6-week pattern of 1-game week. Several studies involving English Premier League teams have also found that during a typical week-pattern microcycle กV 6 full days between matches กV the last training-day before the match (MD-1) commonly has the lowest load [[2],?[8],?[9]]. These results indicate that differences exist in the distribution of TL between high-level football teams, especially in the first three training-days of the microcycle of a full training week-pattern microcycle. The present study found that the first day of a week's training sessions exhibits higher TL values, which decrease until MD-1, independent of the number of games per week.
In one-game week microcycles, the training-days with higher TLs were not coincident. In M1, the MD-2 exhibited greater total distance and high-speed running zones (>19?km/h), whereas in M2, the MD-4 exhibited higher TL. The load distribution pattern of M2 after the first training session of the week for a 1-game week is similar to those reported within the literature [[2],?[8],?[9],?[32]]. Possible reasons for these differences could be the association between the different training session durations (Table 2) and the different levels of intensity applied by the coach. For example, M1 in MD-2 exhibited a longer duration (88?min) and therefore, higher values. However, M2 had higher values in MD-4 with a duration of only 32?min. This can possibly be explained by the application of a high-intensity training approach or simply due to the context and competitive schedule and the objectives related to the training load management.
With regard to the 2-game week microcycle (M3), all external TL variables decreased from MD-4 to MD-1, and there was a significant difference of MD-1 for all days. However, M4 exhibited a different pattern: MD-4?>?MD-3?<?MD-2?>?MD-1, which means that MD-4 and MD-2 exhibited higher TL. Anderson et al. [2], when examining the same week pattern, reported that MD-3 exhibits the highest TL. However, it is important to note that in their study, there was a day-off after the match-day, which likely means that MD-4 was used for a recovery training session and therefore, would exhibit a lower TL.
Singularly, in the M5 (3-game week microcycle), the day with the greater external TL was the day after the match (MD-2, corresponding to days 2 and 5 of the week) for total distance and all covered distances (zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and there were significant differences between MD-2 and MD-1 (corresponding to day 2 and day 3, and day 5 and day 6) with the exception of zone 5, high-speed running distance (>25?km/h), which did not exhibit any significant differences. Moreover, this 3-game week microcycle did not have a day-off, unlike in the study conducted by Anderson et al. [2], occurring 2 training sessions between matches. Similarly, high-speed running zone 5 (>25?km/h) decreased as match-day approached, however no differences were observed between all training days within each week-pattern microcycle (Table 3). Moreover, no pattern was determined for these days, except for the day before the match.
4.2.?Comparison between microcycles
In the present study, there wereno significant differences between internal TL, s-RPE and RPE for microcycles of one-, two- or three-game weeks(see?Fig. 1,?Fig. 2,?Fig. 3,?Fig. 4,?Fig. 5). In contrast, Clemente et al. [28] found significant differences in s-RPE between microcycles of one- and two-game weeks and found smaller values of s-RPE in two-game weeks compared to one-game week. The results suggest that s-RPE may be sensitive to congested periods, but not sensitive to regular periods of training during one-game week [28]. Furthermore, as reported above, RPE may be a psychophysiological and volatile construct [[47],?[48],?[49],?[50]].
A comparison of the weekly internal load for the 3-game week microcycles found that, despite a different distribution of loads across the training microcycle (7?days), the overall TL remains constant (i.e. training sessions plus games loads). Moreover, despite the number of games played in a week, there is no significant difference between weekly s-RPE imposed during actual week-pattern microcycles (1-, 2-, and 3-game weeks, respectively).
Considering the accumulated weekly TL, it is possible to obtain more detailed information regarding the actual subjective response to training prescription for coaches [[16],?[51]]. In the present study, there is no difference between microcycle for s-RPE and their mean range weekly TL was 243-277 arbitrary units (AU). The weekly s-RPEs collected by this study are in accordance with what has previously been found by Scott et al. [24], in the range of 38กV936 AU, but higher than 187 AU for elite soccer players [27]. Unlike in our study, Jeong et al. [27] only used elite professional Korean soccer players while the present study comprises top European soccer players who compete in UEFA competitions. Moreover, the mean for the total weekly TL (based on s-RPE) corresponds to a range of 970กV1110?AU, as a reference for training session prescriptions.
With regard to concentrations of?plasma CK, it appears that coaches use this approach to determine whether athletes are ready to compete in upcoming matches [52]. They use this measurement to prevent injury, observe the effectiveness of an implemented training program, maintain athlete performance and prevent overtraining [53]. In fact, several studies have reported significant correlations between CK and running speeds >4?m.s?1, accelerations and decelerations over a certain magnitude (moderate to high). It has even been suggested that a certain volume of movement at these speeds is necessary for the movement to be strongly associated with CK levels [54]. However, the data collected only reveal a significant difference between M3 and M2 (325.5?กำ?155.0 and 194.4?กำ?48.9, respectively), as can be observed in?Fig. 5. M1 has higher values of CK, which may be associated with high-intensity training sessions, accumulated TL or incomplete recovery of players 48?h before a given match. High CK levels could be related to high intensity exercise however,reveal high variability of this measure is very high and a not consistent poor temporal relationship with muscle recovery exists which possibly means that CK could be an inconsistent marker, with large intra and interindividual variability when used alone, as suggested in previous studyin an isolate form [55]. Finally, CK was only collected 48?h prior to the matches. For future research it is required to collect data from training sessions and matches to better understanding of the results.
For external TL with 1-, 2- and 3-game weeks, the average data obtained are as follows: training duration (67.4; 70.5 and 85.5?min, respectively), total distance (5340.5; 5668.7 and 5105.5?m, respectively), running (195.1; 148.4 and 175.6?m, respectively) and high-speed running (58.5; 46.1 and 22.6?m, respectively). All obtained data are in similar ranges to what other studies have demonstrated (65กV77?min, 3898กV5667?m, 220กV591?m and 41กV205?m, respectively) [[2],?[8],?[9],?[24],?[32]].
We also found no significant differences between microcycles for total distance and for high-speed running distance for zone 5 (>25?km/h). The only difference found concerned the training intensity of zone 4 between M1 and M5. One plausible reason for this may be that there was no change in TL during the microcycles studied, and possibly during all microcycles for the entire in-season. Indeed, coaches and fitness trainers may have imposed a similar weekly TL throughout the entire competitive season, despite the number of games, in the attempt not to overload players.
Anderson et al. [2] have found that, with regard to 2-game weeks, the total weekly accumulated distance and duration of activity is higher than in the 1-game week schedule and includes significantly more time spent in high-intensity zones. However, our results are in accordance with several other studies [56], which have reported no differences between total distance and intensity training zones for 1- and 2-game week microcycles. Once again, these differences may be associated with differences in training session duration (Table 2) and intensity, neither of which were controlled for this study.
Anderson et al. [2] have also stated that the total duration of training sessions and games was higher in the 2-game weeks than in the 1- and 3-game week microcycles. These results contradict the findings in this study, which indicate a higher total duration in the 3-game week microcycles. However, it is important to note that the results of the training sessions during the microcycles studied by Anderson et al. [2] were different from our study. For instance, in a 3-game week microcycle, there were only two training sessions, while in our study there were four.
Moreover, Anderson et al. [2] determined a higher total distance covered in the 3-game week compared with the 1-game week. In our study, however, we did not find any significant difference likely due to the distances covered during matches. The study of Anderson et al. [2] revealed that the coach adjusts the load for different week-pattern microcycles. Indeed, the coach increased the total distance covered in a 1-game week training session, then decreased it in a 2-game week, and then further decreased it during a 3-game week.
In accordance with the findings of Owen et al. [57], it is expected to reduce TL two days before a match to reduce the number of physical stressors imposed upon the players. This statement agrees with our results if we consider the values of all internal and external TL for the last day of all the microcycles studied. As reported by Stevens et al. [32], in different full-week microcycles there is limited time for recovery and physiological conditioning, since the last days were too close to the match and therefore would most probable cause pre-match fatigue. Our TL data conforms to this statement (Table 3).
Although several studies determined that training sessions differed depending on how many games were played each week (one, two, or three), our study reveals that, during in-season for a top European soccer team, matches are probably the most important physiological stimulus during the competitive season. The simultaneous use of both GPS and tracking system to quantify training sessions and matches, respectively, has obvious implications for the comparability of data between systems [[2],?[40]]. This study is also reflective of one top elite European soccer team only that played European matches and may not be representative of the customary training demands of other domestic teams that did not played European matches [23] that may be influenced by different coaching philosophies [2]. Although the weekly scenarios were based on the number of players who completed all training sessions and played at least one match in each microcycle, it is possible that the results may be different if we include players that also completed exercise training sessions, but zero matches. This could be considered for future research. Also, all microcycles analysed were related to home matches what could interfere in the results.
5.?Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a specific analysis of 1-, 2-, and 3-game weeks of internal and external TL simultaneously. Indeed, this study quantifies the daily training and accumulative weekly and match load in professional elite European soccer team during a one-, two- and three-game week schedule. It is important to note that customary TLs did not exhibit a regular pattern for one- and two-game week microcycles for either external TL (distances of different exercise training intensity zones) nor internal TL (s-RPE, CK). Moreover, the evidence indicates a particular fact of periodisation in training during the day before a match, because all external and internal TL variables were reduced. Another major finding is that the values of external TL for distances of different exercise training intensity (zones 1กV4) were never reached in training sessions with the exception of M5 (three-game weeks) in comparison to the values reported in matches. The values recorded during games also indicate that a high-running speed distance (zone 5, > 24 Km/h) was never reached. The enzymatic parameter CK did not increase in weeks with two- or three-game weeks as expected, which confirms that weekly match load was likely considered in the daily management of TL (during training sessions).
Our study also reveals that internal training and external training differ on a daily basis during different microcycles. Moreover, in each analysis performed, there may be no correspondence between them. As such, a careful analysis of each variable should be conducted for each day or each microcycle. Future studies should also consider, for example, an individualized analysis of the TL (external and internal) in accordance with the position of the players. Furthermore, is important to understand whether several contextual variables, such as the opponent level, the match result or the time during the season, could affect the results.
6.?Practical applications
This study provides useful information regarding the TLs of an elite European soccer team that plays in a European Champions league. It provides further evidence of the value of using a combination of different monitoring measures to fully evaluate the TL patterns observed across a full competitive season. Moreover, appropriate doses of training stimulus could improve performance and protect against possible injury [58]. It is, therefore, important for physical fitness and sports technicians to determine the optimum quantity of training required for a player to continue improving his/her physical fitness, while reducing the probability of injury, in order to maximize his/her performance during competition.
For coaches, this study could provide important information to be considered when planning training sessions. The significant differences found in daily and accumulated loads within- and between-game schedules could have implications for weekly periodization. To ensure that fatigue is properly managed, TLs should be adjusted at various times during the different week microcycles. Based on the data obtained, it is possible to retrospectively examine loadกVperformance relationships and to enable appropriate planning for TLs depending on the number of games. Data may also be useful for team selection and determining which athletes are ready for the demands of competition.
Data collected from the training monitoring can also be useful to facilitate communication between the support staff and the coaching staff.
