Abstract
Rago, V, Rebelo, A, Krustrup, P, and Mohr, M. Contextual variables and training load throughout a competitive period in a top-level male soccer team.?J Strength Cond Res?35(11): 3177¡V3183, 2021¡XThe aim of the present study was to investigate and quantify the weekly training load (TL) according to different match-related contextual factors in a professional male soccer team (n?= 23). Training load was quantified using a 10-Hz global positioning system with integrated 100-Hz accelerometer and heart rate recordings over a 3-month competitive period. Total distance (TD) covered and high-speed running (HSR, >16 km¡Ph?1) during training were higher in the week after playing against a bottom-level or top-level opponent compared to a medium-level opponent (p?< 0.05; effect size [ES] = 0.30¡V1.04). TD was also higher when preparing for a match against a bottom-level opponent (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.39¡V0.76). In addition, the percentage of HSR was higher after playing a bottom-level compared to a medium-level opponent (p?< 0.001; ES = 0.49 [0.27; 0.71]). TD covered was higher in the week following a draw or a win, and higher before a loss compared to a draw (p?< 0.05, ES = 0.32¡V0.81). Both absolute HSR and HSR expressed as percentage of TD were higher before losing and winning a match compared to a draw (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.72¡V0.98). Weekly TL seems to be slightly affected by match-related contextual variables, with special emphasis on the opponent standard and match outcome. Higher training volume was observed before and after playing against a top-level opponent, and after losing a match, whereas the volume of high-intensity training seems to be higher when preparing for a game against a top-level opponent. Future experimental research should clarify the interaction between match-related contextual variables (e.g., cause) and weekly TL (e.g., effect).
Introduction
Training load (TL) monitoring, which has become one of the most critical areas of sports science support in contemporary soccer, aims to generate information concerning attainment of peak performance to enable a certain level of protection against injury, and to provide an evidence-based and systematic approach to management decisions when prescribing training (6,19). The large amount of published studies, combined with available TL monitoring technologies on the market, has resulted in practitioners having more choices than previously (14). Despite the inherent benefits of TL monitoring, there are meaningful challenges for practitioners in implementing monitoring strategies. For instance, coaches need to take into consideration the possible confounding effect of match-related parameters on TL interpretation (7,25).
Contextual factors such as opponent standard, match location, and match outcome have a meaningful impact on players' activity profile during a competitive game (2,9,13,27). For instance, professional soccer players demonstrate higher total distance (TD), high-speed running (HSR), acceleration/deceleration distance, and peak higher speed values when playing against a stronger opponent (a top-five side) (2,9,13,27). In support of this, a recent study demonstrated that competing against a top-level team is perceived to be more demanding than playing against a bottom-level team (a bottom-five side) (3). Significant effects were also reported regarding match location and match status, with higher TD covered during home games or when the reference team was losing (9). Although this information about contextual factors could assist match analysts, there is currently a lack of knowledge about TL. U19 professional soccer players perceived higher weekly TLs after a defeat or draw compared to a win, and when preparing to play against a medium-level team compared to a bottom- or top-level team (7). Despite the inherent advantages offered by the rating of perceived exertion (RPE)-based TL method, its accuracy is questionable because of the complex interaction of numerous components that contribute to personal perception of physical exertion. For example, concentrations of hormones and neurotransmitters, substrate levels, external factors (environment and spectators), psychological states, previous experience, and memory may all limit the use of RPE in accurately quantifying training intensity and workload (1,6,25). In addition, players may be unwilling to report perception of fatigue, as this may prevent them from being available for team selection (25). All of these concerns should be taken into account when developing a strategy to assess training and match load.
Alongside the large number of commercially available TL-monitoring technologies, players and coaches have become more familiar with wearable micro-sensors. For instance, global positioning systems (GPSs) quantify the volume of activity performed by players based on a satellite navigation network that provides location and frame information for tracking devices (21). Conventional GPS-derived measures include TD, which is commonly used as a measure of overall training volume, and HSR, which is commonly applied to quantify the volume of high-intensity activity (8). However, because these measures are only quantified in 2 planes of movement (x and y), GPS devices commonly integrate accelerometers and gyroscopes, enabling the quantification of events related to changes in speed (e.g., number of accelerations and decelerations). The recent GPS software also allows the direct integration of heart rate (HR) recordings by only integrating an HR sensor that is automatically detected by the GPS device. Heart rate measurements allow the objective quantification of exercise intensity in response to the activity performed by the players (12). Mean HR (HRmean) during exercise is associated with oxygen consumption during continuous exercise (when expressed as a percentage of maximum HR) and is commonly used to describe the load imposed on the aerobic system (12).
As far as we know, only one study has investigated the effect of match-related contextual variables on TL (7). This study was conducted in young (U19) players and used subjective measures of TL, so information relating to older top-level players would be of interest and the integration of objective TL measures may add worthwhile information for sports scientists and anyone else involved in TL monitoring in soccer. Thus, the aim of the present study was to quantify the weekly TL according to different match-related contextual factors (e.g., opponent standard, match location, and match outcome) in a top-level male soccer team.
Methods
Experimental Approach to the Problem
The players' TL was quantified over a 3-month competitive period from February to May. The present study was conducted in nonexperimental conditions in which the research problem was embedded. A deductive logic (posteriori?to data collection) was adopted, as the technical staff and subjects did not receive any input from the research team. The generic training and competitive schedule completed by the soccer players involved in this study were supplied by the technical staff of the team. Sixty-seven training sessions and 15 competitive matches were performed. Of these 67 training sessions, 24 included speed endurance training (e.g., repeated sprint activity) and 26 aerobic high-intensity training (e.g., interval training). The remaining training sessions mainly concerned ball-possession games and team/opponent tactics. Individual/reconditioning sessions were excluded from the analysis. The final analysis included a total of 828 individual training sessions (player median = 35.5; range = 14¡V45). Three contextual variables were considered, as previously described (7): opponent level (top, first to sixth in the current rankings; medium, 7th to 14th; and bottom, 15th to 20th); match location (home and away); and match outcome (win, draw, and loss).
Subjects
During the second half of the 2017/2018 season, 23 male outfield soccer players (mean ¡Ó?SD; age, 27.8 ¡Ó 3.9 years; height, 177.9 ¡Ó 6.4 cm; body mass, 72.7 ¡Ó 11.9 kg), including 8 representing their respective national teams, competing in the top Spanish league (LaLiga) were regularly monitored in the context of their team routine. These data derived from routinely measured player activities over the course of the competitive season, so no informed consent was required (28). At the end of the season, the club and the players verbally authorized the use of a dataset for research purposes provided that anonymity was ensured. During the data analysis, individual player identity was coded and presented anonymously. The Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Sports at the University of Porto approved and recorded the study under ¡§CEFADE.08.2018¡¨.
Procedures
External Training Load
The amount of activity performed by the players was measured using a 10-Hz GPS (WIMU PRO; RealTrack Systems SL) with a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer integrated sampling at 100 Hz. These devices (85 ¡Ñ 48 ¡Ñ 15 mm, 65 g) were fitted to the upper back of each player using adjustable harnesses (Ras?n, Valencia, Spain). Data were analyzed using the system-specific software (WIMU Software; RealTrack Systems SL). This system showed good accuracy for measures of running speed (4), acceleration, and deceleration (24) in relation to gold-standard measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93¡V0.97). All devices were always activated 15 minutes before data collection to allow acquisition of satellite signals in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Nonetheless, data were trimmed from the actual start of the session (start of on-pitch warm-up) to the end (before cool-down/stretching). To avoid inter-unit error, the players wore the same device for each training session (15). Total distance and HSR (>16 km¡Ph?1) were calculated from instantaneous raw data for time, speed, and distance available from the manufacturer's software, and the minimum effort duration was 0.2 seconds. The speed threshold of >16 km¡Ph?1?is supposedly the average maximal aerobic speed in professional soccer players (26). To remove the effect of training volume, HSR was also expressed as a percentage of TD within the training session. In addition, the number of accelerations >3 m¡Ps?2?(Acc3) and decelerations <?3 m¡Ps?2?(Dec3) was retrieved from the accelerometer. External TL was reported as the volume of work performed (actual distance covered in m) during the whole microcycle (1 week of training sessions before the next match). In addition, to remove the effect of the microcycle length, weekly external TL was normalized by the between-match duration, dividing the cumulative weekly distance (or number of efforts) by the number of training sessions.
Internal Training Load
Physiological responses to training were recorded every 5 seconds using a short-range telemetry system (WIMU PRO; RealTrack Systems, Almeria, Spain). This device has been shown to be valid, giving an almost perfect correlation with gold-standard measurements of HR during exercise (r?= 0.97) (23). The physiological intensity of all training sessions was indicated in relative terms (i.e., the corresponding percentage of HRmax). The players' HRmax?was 193.8 ¡Ó 5.2 b¡Pmin?1, determined by an incremental treadmill protocol at the start of the season. Internal TL was reported using average daily values for HRmean?in a given microcycle.
Statistical Analyses
Shapiro¡VWilk's test revealed that TL data were normally distributed within each microcycle (p?> 0.05). Differences between contextual factors were analyzed using a linear mixed model with unstructured covariance, taking into consideration the fact that the subjects differed with respect to the number of training sessions in which they participated (10,20). The contextual factors were set as fixed effects, individual subjects were set as random effects, and TL was the dependent variable. When a significant effect was found, pairwise comparisons were analyzed using a post-hoc Bonferroni test. The magnitudes of difference were subsequently quantified using effect sizes (ES) according to Hopkins, et al. (17), namely trivial (ES < 0.2), small (0.2 < ES < 0.6), moderate (0.6 < ES < 1.2), large (1.2 < ES < 2.0), very large (2.0 < ES < 4.0), and huge (ES > 4.0). For both differences and correlations, associated 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) were calculated. When 90% CIs overlapped positive and negative values, the effect was deemed to be unclear. Otherwise, the effect was deemed to be the observed magnitude (5).
Descriptive data were reported as mean ¡Ó?SD?for each variable. Significance was set at?p?? 0.05. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science software (version 25, IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL).
Results
Overview of the Weekly Training Load
Across the data collection period, the team played 15 competitive games, 4 of which were against top-level teams, 6 against medium-level teams, and 5 against bottom-level teams. With respect to match location, 7 matches were played at home and 8 matches away (median distance from home venue 603 km; range 64¡V1,166 km). Specifically, 7 of 8 away fixtures were reached by airplane and 1 by bus. The team won 2 matches, drew 5 matches, and lost 7 matches. Weekly TD and Acc3 during training decreased as the season progressed from mid-season toward the end of season (p?< 0.05;?Figure 1). No significant seasonal changes were observed in HSR, Dec3, and HRmean?(p?> 0.05;?Figure 1).

The gray-filled spaces indicate congested periods (?3 days between matches).
Main Effect¡XOpponent Level
Total distance covered and HSR during training were slightly to largely higher in the week after playing against a bottom-level or a top-level opponent compared with a medium-level opponent (p?< 0.05; TD, ES = 0.30 [0.08; 0.51] and 1.04 [0.63; 1.45], respectively; HSR, ES = 0.49 [0.28; 0.71] and 0.89 [0.48; 1.30], respectively) (Figure 2A). Total distance was slightly to moderately higher in the week before playing against a bottom-level opponent compared to a medium-level or top-level opponent (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.39 [0.16; 0.62] and 0.76 [0.46; 1.06]), whereas no significant differences were observed in HSR (p?> 0.05) (Figure 2A). Similarly, the number of Acc3 and Dec3 was higher in the week before playing against a bottom-level opponent compared to a medium-level opponent (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.56 [0.33; 0.80] and 0.68 [0.44; 0.91], respectively) (Figure 2B). With respect to exercise intensity, the percentage of HSR covered during training was higher in the week after playing against a bottom-level opponent compared to a medium-level opponent (p?< 0.001; ES = 0.49 [0.27; 0.71]), whereas no opponent standard effect was observed for HRmean?during training (p?> 0.05) (Figure 2D).

Main Effect¡XMatch Outcome
Total distance covered during training was higher in the week after losing a match compared to a draw or a win (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.37 [0.14; 0.60] and 0.81 [0.50; 1.11]), and after a draw compared to a win (p?= 0.04, ES = 0.32 [0.02; 0.62]) (Figure 4A). In addition, TD was slightly higher before losing a match compared to a draw (p?< 0.01; ES = 0.44 [0.31; 0.77]). High-speed running was moderately higher in the week before losing a match, and before winning a match compared to a draw (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.81 [0.57; 1.05] and 0.98 [0.66; 1.29], respectively) (Figure 4A). The number of Acc3 and Dec3 was slightly to moderately higher after losing a match compared to a draw and a win (p?< 0.05; Acc3, ES = 0.44 [0.21; 0.67] and 0.74 [0.44; 0.1.04], respectively; Dec3, 0.45 [0.22; 0.69] and 0.85 [0.55; 1.16]), and after a draw compared to a win (p?< 0.05; Acc3, ES = 0.39 [0.09; 0.69]; Dec3, ES = 0.46 [0.16; 0.76]) (Figure 4B). The percentage of HSR covered within the training session was moderately higher in the week before a loss and a win compared to a draw (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.72 [0.49; 0.96] and 0.90 [0.59; 1.22], respectively) (Figure 4C). HRmean?during training was moderately higher in the week before a win compared to a loss or a draw (p?< 0.05; ES = 0.65 [0.33; 0.97] and 0.65 [0.32; 0.98], respectively).

Discussion
The main finding of this study was that weekly TLs in a top-class soccer team seem to be affected by match-related contextual variables. In particular, these effects seem more evident in the standard of the opponent and the results of the previous and following games rather than in game location. Overall, higher training volume was observed in the week after playing against a top-level opponent, and after losing a game. Game location seems to have little influence on weekly TL, showing decreased mechanical work (Acc3 and Dec3) in the week before playing an away game, with no effect on the remaining variables. In addition, a higher volume of high-intensity training was observed in the week after playing against a bottom-level opponent. Curiously, exercise intensity and physiological responses to training seem higher before winning a game. These findings add evidence to the single previous study investigating the influence of match-related contextual factors on weekly TLs using players' subjective ratings (7). In an attempt to address the limitations of subjective measures of TLs, we therefore integrated objective indicators of external and internal TL. Acknowledging the observational nature of the present study, future research is warranted to clarify whether a true cause-effect exists between match-related contextual variables and weekly TL.
The decrease in training volume (e.g., TD) and mechanical work (accelerations and decelerations) performed throughout the season may have been related to changes in training activities prescribed by the technical staff as a consequence of cumulative seasonal TL. Notably, the players included in this analysis were highly exposed to competitive fixtures, and the volume of training decreased as the season progressed. However, HSR, Dec3, and HR loading during training remained stable toward the end of the season, indicating that the volume of high-intensity training and exercise intensity were maintained. This is in contrast to previous findings showing a decrease in internal TL self-reported by top-level U19 male players (7). A seasonal decrease in internal TL previously documented (7) could be associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness in this cohort of athletes (unpublished observations), and a consequent lower physiological response to training in the fittest athletes (22).
Higher TD and HSR were observed in the present study after playing a match against a top-level opponent. Higher training volume may have occurred simply as result of increased volume of high-intensity training within the training session. This is surprising given the higher work rate and degree of fatigue commonly observed during matches against stronger teams (2,9,13,27). It is therefore expected that coaches decrease the weekly TLs of starting players as a recovery strategy, because of the opponent-induced match load. Otherwise, players may increase their work rate with a view to match selection. Collectively, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the cause-effect between match-related contextual variables and changes in the volume of activity performed by the players. In addition, no differences in weekly internal TL were observed with respect to the previous or next opponent. Our findings therefore contrast with previous findings in U19 players showing lower s-RPE after playing against a top-level opponent (7). The relationship between the volume of HSR and s-RPE has been documented in highly trained soccer players (16). High perceptual responses to training may therefore have been found in our study after playing against a stronger opponent. However, this cannot be confirmed because in the present study the technical staff had no input from the research team and RPE data were not collected. Future studies investigating the effect of match-related contextual variables should therefore include both subjective and objective TL indicators. However, a higher volume of intense mechanical work (e.g., Acc3 and Dec3) has been found when preparing for a game against a bottom-level opponent. It is possible that coaches decrease the volume of high-intensity activity in favor of tactical preparation (e.g., corner kicks, free kicks, or game-specific single situations) against top-level opponents simply to reduce muscle damage (18), while focusing on other components such as psychological preparation. This could possibly explain the higher rate of mechanical work when preparing for a game against a weaker team. Alternatively, increased work rate with stable physiological responses may indicate improved cardiorespiratory fitness and readiness to train and compete (22).
A game location effect was observed in Acc3 and Dec3 only when preparing for away games. A possible explanation for decreased muscle work imposed by the coaches, or possibly induced by the players' pacing strategy, could be an expected impaired recovery (e.g., team travel and impaired sleep) when travelling for away matches (11). However, our findings contrast with those of Brito et al. (7), who observed higher s-RPE after playing an away match. This could be explained by the fact that players still had residual fatigue when rating TL. Consequently, training intensity could be perceived as higher as a result of cumulative loads over the previous days. However, given that soccer teams normally alternate home and away matches, the volume of high-intensity activity was higher when preparing for an away game compared to a home game. This phenomenon could perhaps be explained by the possibility of improving recovery strategy (e.g., no travel) after home games and consequently increasing the weekly training stimulus.
Our analysis of match outcome revealed higher weekly training volume after losing a match. This is partially supported by higher weekly TL scores reported after a loss or draw compared to a win in U19 players over an entire season (7). However, caution should be exercised when generalizing our findings. Indeed, during the data collection period the team had 2 wins, 5 draws, and 6 losses over less than half a season. A major limitation of the present study is that our dataset only included training sessions (n?= 828) from the beginning of the second half of the season (February) to the end of the season (May). Previous data, i.e., for preseason and the first half of the competitive period, were not available because of an early coach dismissal. Future studies investigating the effect of match-related contextual variables should be conducted over an entire season or across multiple teams and seasons.
It is important to note various limitations inherent in the present research, with the most important concerning the impossibility of obtaining a cause-effect relationship from observational studies. First, given the reduced sample size (e.g., team study) we have not accounted for the starting status. For instance, if the weekly TL was reduced for starting players, nonstarting players might have experienced higher weekly TLs than advised. Second, it was not possible to adjust TL to individual thresholds based on players' physical capacity. Future studies are therefore warranted to address the aforementioned concerns, taking into consideration that variations in TL are therefore likely to be, firstly, a direct function of coaching decisions and, secondly, of the actual short-term contextual variables of previous and following matches (7).
In summary, this is the first study to quantify the weekly TL according to different match-related contextual variables, using objective indicators derived from wearable micro-sensors in a top-class soccer team. Our findings complement previous research investigating the effect of match-related contextual variables on subjective perceptions of training (7) and could be considered with caution by practitioners involved with TL monitoring in top-level soccer. Notwithstanding, the present study included 2 congested periods with limited time for recovery between competitive matches. However, during typical weeks (5¡V7 days between competitive matches) coaches commonly opt to concentrate the most intense training sessions in the middle of the weekly cycle to prevent excessive loading on the days immediately before and after competitive matches (7). Nonetheless, we adjusted our analysis by normalizing TL data by the number of weekly training sessions. The observed effect of match-related contextual variables on TL in the present study was of small to moderate magnitudes, necessitating the identification of further factors influencing weekly TL in professional soccer.
Practical Applications
Weekly TLs seem to slightly vary (based on the magnitude of differences) according to the standard of the opponent, the location of a game, and the results of the previous and following matches. Overall, higher training volume was observed before and after playing against a top-ranking opponent, and after losing a match. Moreover, the volume of high-intensity training seems to decrease before and after playing against a top-ranking opponent, and to increase after a home game (or when preparing for an away game). Thus, when planning training sessions, soccer coaches need to consider the interplay of the numerous variables that influence the volume of prescribed training (external TL) and the actual training responses in each individual player. However, given the observational nature of the present study, future research is warranted to clarify cause-effect between match-related contextual variables and weekly TL.
