The world ’s most popular sport, so ccer is a global and cultural phenomenon. The television audience for the 2010 World Cup included nearly half of the world ’s population, with viewers in nearly every country. As a reflection of soccer ’s significance, the sport impacts countless aspects of the world ’s culture, from politics and religion to business and the arts. 
In The World through Soccer: The Cultural Impact of a Global Sport , Tamir Bar-On utilizes soccer to provide insights into worldwide politics, religion, ethics, marketing, business, leadership, philosophy, and the arts. Bar-On examines the ways in which soccer influences and reflects these aspects of society, and vice versa. Each chapter features representative players, providing specific examples of how soccer comments on and informs our lives. These players — selected from a wide array of eras, countries, and backgrounds — include Diego Maradona, Pelé, Hugo Sánchez, Cha Bum-Kun, Roger Milla, José Luis Chilavert, Zinedine Zidane, Paolo Maldini, Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi, Neymar, Clint Dempsey, Mia Hamm, and many others. 
Employing a unique lens to view a variety of topics, The World through Soccer reveals the sport ’s profound cultural impact. Combining philosophical, popular, and academic insights about our world, this book is aimed at both soccer fans and academics, offering readers a new perspective into a sport that affects millions.
