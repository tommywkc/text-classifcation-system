Abstract: Background: Sever’s disease, or calcaneal apophysitis, stands as the most prevalent cause
of heel pain in children, often linked to sports like soccer, Australian football, and basketball. While
various therapies are documented in the scientific literature, the standard choice is conservative
treatment. Thus, the objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness of diverse conservative
methods and techniques in alleviating Sever’s disease symptoms. Methods: Systematic searches
were conducted in October 2023 in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SportDiscus, and PEDro, using
terms like Osteochondritis, Osteochondrosis, Apophysitis, Sever’s disease, Calcaneus, Adolescent,
Child, and Childhood. The PEDro scale gauged methodological quality, and the Cochrane Risk of
Bias tool evaluated the risk of bias. Results: Eight randomized controlled studies were included,
featuring commonly used treatments such as insoles, therapeutic exercises, Kinesio taping, and
foot orthoses. The methodological quality was generally good, with an average PEDro score of
6.75 points. Regarding bias, four articles had low risk, three had high risk, and one had some concern.

Conclusions: Conservative treatment emerges as an effective option for alleviating symptoms
associated with Sever’s disease.

Sever’s disease stands as the most common cause of heel pain in children and young
individuals [1,2,5–7], with an incidence of 3.7 per 1000 patients [1,2,5]. It is a common musculoskeletal disorder, representing between 2% and 16% of consultations in sports
clinics [8,9] and accounting for 5.8–22.7% of repetitive stress injuries in children [10–12].

body mass index as a risk factor, with some studies not identifying it as significant [16,17]
while others do [4,5]. Nevertheless, asymmetry has been observed in the distribution of
weight in patients with SVD, being greater in the heel with more pain [18]. Engagement
in high-intensity sports like soccer, Australian football, and basketball is proposed to
contribute to SVD development [17,19]; also, enrolling in a new sport may be associated
with it [6]. Additionally, cartilaginous diseases such as Osgood–Schlatter disease have been observed to play a role in the development of SVD [20].

Currently, there are no clinical guidelines recommending the best treatment for SVD,
but previous systematic reviews have emphasized the goal of facilitating tissue healing [1].

The first goal of treatment is pain relief [6]. A proper clinical investigation is important in obtaining this goal, including history-taking and a physical exam [21]. Usually, a positive heel squeeze test is sufficient and indicative of SVD. Nevertheless, radiographic imaging
can exclude other differential diagnoses [4, 22,23].

Commonly used treatments include stretching and lengthening of the triceps surae
muscle, ice application, restriction or limitation of physical activity, rest, topical non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, taping, and the use of foot orthoses and heel cushions [1,2,4, 24]. Foot orthoses and heel cushions are often considered the most effective methods for reducing pain
scores [25]. Patients tent to be pain-free after a time period ranging from a few weeks to several months [4,7]. Return to play fluctuates from two to eight weeks [4,7, 24]. It is important to educate parents and coaches for the early diagnosis of SVD [1]. Although there are no clinical guidelines for preventing SVD, systematic reviews highlight the importance of educational,
environmental, and physical interventions [1].

A systematic review published in 2013 focused on interventions for pain reduction in
SVD, including only three randomized controlled trials [26]. Currently, there is no updated systematic review analyzing the effect of conservative treatment in SVD, despite it being
standard care [1]. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to analyze and evaluate the scientific evidence of the effects of different conservative methods and techniques to
improve symptoms of SVD.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Sources and Searches
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO on 30 September 2023, with
the code CRD42023464493. The research adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [27]; Exercise, Rehabilitation,
Sport Medicine, and Sports (PERSIST) recommendations [28]; and the Cochrane Collabo-
ration guidelines [29,30]. The PICO question was formulated as follows: P—population:
patients with SVD; I—intervention: conservative methods and techniques; C—control:
surgical treatment, placebo, or non-intervention; O—outcome: characteristics of pain and
disability; S—study designs: randomized controlled trials.

A systematic search of publications was conducted in October 2023 across multiple
databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SportDiscus, and PeDro. The search
strategy involved several combinations, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms
such as Osteochondritis, Osteochondrosis, Calcaneus, Adolescent, and Child. Addition-
ally, free terms like Apophysitis, Sever’s disease, Sever, Calcaneus, and Childhood were
included. The detailed search strategy used, according to the focused PICOS question, is
presented in Table 1.

2.2. Study Selection
After removing duplicates, two reviewers (P.H.-L.; H.D.-B.) independently conducted
the initial screening of articles for eligibility. In instances of disagreement, a third reviewer
(R.L.-R.) was involved in making the final decision on whether to include the study or not.

The following inclusion criteria were applied for study selection: (i) articles employing
conservative techniques (e.g., insoles, therapeutic exercise, taping, and foot orthoses, etc.)

and (ii) studies with samples consisting of participants with SVD. Studies were excluded
if they met the following criteria: (i) studies other than randomized controlled trials and
(ii) research involving participants older than 19 years.

Following the initial screening, titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion criteria,
and the selected abstracts were obtained in full text. Titles and abstracts lacking sufficient
information regarding inclusion criteria were also obtained as full texts. Full-text articles
were selected if they met the inclusion criteria, with both reviewers using a data extraction
form. The two reviewers (P.H.-L.; H.D.-B.) independently extracted data from the included
studies, using a customized data extraction table in Microsoft Excel 2016. In cases of
disagreement, the two reviewers engaged in discussions until a consensus was reached.

2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The following data were extracted for further analysis: demographic information
(title, authors, journal, and year), characteristics of the sample (age, gender, inclusion and
exclusion criteria, and number of participants), study-specific parameters (duration of the
intervention, adverse events, conservative methods, and techniques), and results obtained
(variables analyzed, instruments used, and time of follow-up). Tables were used to describe
both the characteristics of the studies and the extracted data. The PEDro scale [31] was
employed to assess the quality of studies, and the RoB (Risk of Bias) tool [29] was applied to assess the risk of bias. Two reviewers (P.H.-L.; H.D.-B.) conducted the application of the
PEDro and RoB scales. In cases of disagreement, a third author (R.L.-R.) was also involved
in the process to achieve agreement. Descriptive techniques were used in the quantitative
analysis, including the determination of means, standard deviations, and percentages.

3. Results
3.1. Studies Included
The literature review process identified a total of 411 articles. After removing dupli-
cates and conducting the initial screening, a total of 120 eligible articles were analyzed.

After the review, those that matched the object of study of this review and met the inclusion
criteria were utilized for analysis; the final analysis was performed on a total of eight
studies (Figure 1).

3.3. Participants Characteristics
In the studies analyzed, the participants consisted mostly of male patients. In four
of the articles studied [32–35], the sample was entirely male. In two others, it did not
reach 30% of women [37,38]; in one of them, the percentage of females was 90.6% [36],
and in just one, the sample was balanced, with 42% females [26]. In relation to age ranges, these ranged from 7 to 15 years old, with mean ages ranging from 10.3 ± 1.6 years [36] to
13.18 ± 2.15 [32]. Subjects were mostly recruited through clinics or hospital services, with medical diagnoses. Similarly, in most of the studies, the participants presented physically
active subjects, specifying that they practiced physical activity between 2.7 and 3.7 h per
week [38], which was unspecified but used as an inclusion criterion [37]. Also, children were recruited from different sports like soccer [32], high-level athletics [33], or barefoot sports (gymnastics, acrobatics, dance, or martial arts) [36]. Participants in the following four articles [26,36] had no adverse effects, although it should be noted that these were not mentioned in the following articles [32–35].

3.4. Studies Characteristics
In the study design, most studies included specific treatment groups to evaluate the
effects of the interventions. Sweeney et al. [36] and Alfaro-Santafé et al. [37] compared the use of heel pads; Kuyucu et al. [32] employed Kinesio taping and a sham version (in
addition to considering topical analgesics, stretching, and targeted massage therapy). On
the other hand, Wiegerinck et al. [38] employed three treatment groups, including physical
therapy, the use of heel raises (ViscoHeel, Bauerfeind), and a wait-and-see approach as a
control group, allowing for direct comparisons between interventions. James et al. [26]
conducted a study that included four intervention groups with different combinations of
footwear and orthoses (usual footwear and heel raise, new footwear and heel raises, usual
footwear and orthoses, and new footwear and orthoses), including a “wait and see” control
group that allowed for comparisons. In the third study, Perhamre et al. [35] included a
comparison of the heel cup and heel wedge. However, they compared the effectiveness of
these treatments in relation to the pilot group that did not receive any specific intervention
(Table 3).

3.5. Outcomes Measurements
In the studies analyzed, the participants mostly consisted of male patients. In four of
the articles studied [32–35], the sample was entirely male. In two others, it did not reach 30% of female [37,38]. In the study design, most studies included specific treatment groups to evaluate the effects of the interventions. Sweeney et al. [36] and Alfaro-Santafé et al. [37]
compared the use of heel pads, similarly to Kuyucu et al. [32].

The studies presented their results on the basis of rating scales. Scales for the percep-
tion and intensity of pain experienced in the heel such as the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
were widely used in most studies to measure pain perception in participants [26,32–35].

This scale provided a basis for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in reduc-
ing pain. Other studies [36,38] used the OxAFQ (Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire) scale
to assess foot- and ankle-related function and quality of life.

In the three studies by Perhamre et al. [33,34], the use of the heel cup and heel wedge
resulted in a significant reduction in pain, with patients preferring the heel cup. Also, a
positive correlation was observed between the level of physical activity and pain reduction
in both groups, with a greater reduction in the more intense and more painful activities. In
other studies, such as Sweeney et al. [36] and Kuyucu et al. [32], no significant differences in VAS were found between treatment groups, suggesting that the treatments did not
significantly influence pain perception.

Regarding the OxAFQ, Sweeney et al. [36] found that the groups treated with Tuli’s
Cheetah Heel Cup and Tuli’s The X Brace showed no significant differences in the measure-
ments. The results indicated that the Heel Cup may be effective in reducing pain. On the
other hand, the study by Kuyucu et al. [32] used the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot
and Ankle Society) Scale to measure ankle dorsiflexion, and, in this analysis, significant
differences in dorsiflexion were observed thanks to the use of Kinesio taping compared to
the simulated tape, but these differences did not increase over time (Table 3).

3.6. Treatments Used and Results for Quality-of-Life Improvement
The treatments in the studies were aligned with the aim of finding therapeutic solutions
to improve the quality of life of patients affected by this condition. For this reason, all the
studies analyzed and performed measurements using pain perception scales. Sweeney [36],
Alfaro-Santafé et al. [37], Kuyucu et al. [32], Wiegerinck et al. [38], James et al. [26], and Perhamre et al. [34] focused on understanding how different treatments affect pain in
this population.

There was high variability in the treatments, with a majority examining the use of
heel cups and shoe inserts, such as Tuli’s Cheetah Heel Cup and Tuli’s The X Brace [21],
custom-made foot orthoses and off-the-shelf heel lifts [37], and the use of heel cups and
heel wedges with varying insole thickness, as in Perhamre et al. [33–35]. In addition to
these interventions, Kuyucu et al. [32] explored Kinesio taping, and Perhamre et al. [34] and Wiegerinck et al. [38] investigated physical therapy. The results supported the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing pain associated with SVD, noting that subjects who used
pain reduction mechanisms improved their quality of life (Table 3).

4. Discussion
This systematic review focused on evaluating the impacts of conservative treatment in
cases of SVD. The findings indicate the beneficial impact of these interventions, particularly
highlighting the use of orthopedic insoles [26,33–38], physical therapy [38] and Kinesio tape [32]. The application of insoles has shown a reduction in pain and an increase in ankle functionality in patients with SVD [26,33–38], although the types of insoles were different, such as a prefabricated heel raising inlay [26,37,38], an elastic surface heel inlay [34,35],
a rigid thermoplastic heel inlay [33–35], prefabricated orthoses [26], custom-made food orthoses [37], a neoprene ankle brace with a built-in multicell and multilayer waffle heel
cup [36], and an elastic foot brace with an integrated silicone strip on the heel strap [36].

The type of orthoses used was very different between studies; therefore, it is difficult to
generalize, although those that were personalized provided a better result. This effect may
be due to the physiological remodeling necessary for the development of injury-resistant
tissues, requiring physical activity with repeated impact on the hindfoot according to
Wolff’s Law [39]. In SVD, there seems to be a disturbance in this relationship between
stimulus load and developmental capacity [40]. Insoles provide cushioning and therefore
reduce the impact force on the calcaneus during heel strike [40]. A previous systematic
review, including studies up to May 2012, suggests that the implementation of heel lifts
could decrease pain in cases of SVD [26]. However, a cautious interpretation of these results is recommended, as they are based on only three randomized clinical trials [26].

This study reinforces the conclusions of James et al.’s systematic review [26] and
additionally reports an improvement in foot functionality in children with SVD after
using insoles. This is consistent, considering the close relationship between pain and
disability [41]. It is important to note that, although the methodological quality of the
studies included in James et al.’s systematic review [26], assessed using the PEDro scale,
was rated as poor, this present review classifies the methodological quality of the studies as
good [31].

Physical therapy has also proven to be beneficial for heel pain [42] and, specifically,
in treating SVD [38]. The studies reviewed highlight the finding that the application of
physical therapy, including specific stretches and massages, can lead to a significant de-
crease in pain and improved ankle functionality in patients with SVD [38]. This therapeutic approach may have a positive impact on recovery by directly addressing ankle dorsiflexion
restriction, one of the features associated with SVD [38].

Kinesio tape has also been explored as an intervention in SVD, and Kuyucu et al.’s
study [32] suggests it may have benefits in improving ankle dorsiflexion. Although the
results of this specific study should be interpreted with caution, as differences did not
increase over time, the application of Kinesio tape could be considered as part of a compre-
hensive treatment strategy to address dorsiflexion limitations and reduce pain in patients
with SVD [32].

Overall, these findings support the effectiveness of conservative treatment, including
the use of orthopedic insoles, physical therapy, and Kinesio tape, in improving symptoms
and functionality in patients with SVD. However, it is essential to consider that, while these
results are promising, the heterogeneity of interventions and limited sample sizes in some
studies highlight the need for larger and more rigorous future research to consolidate these
conclusions. Additionally, it is crucial to consider individual patient characteristics when
selecting and customizing conservative interventions for the treatment of SVD.

Another additional explanation for the beneficial effects of insoles [26,33–38], as well
as physical therapy [38] and Kinesio tape [32], is that SVD may be related to an increase in tension or shortening of the Achilles tendon, a common phenomenon during rapid
growth in adolescence [43]. This modification in soft tissue could lead to high traction at the insertion point of the apophysis, causing pain and inflammation [40,44]. Additionally,
SVD is associated with other conditions that cause tension in the posterior myofascial chain,
such as short hamstring syndrome [45]. Consequently, it has been suggested that a simple
heel lift can be effective in relieving this tension when wearing shoes [46–48]. Similarly, this tension can be reduced with the help of physical therapy [38, 48] or taping [32, 44].

Conservative treatment, by relieving pain and improving functionality [26,32–38],
allows children to avoid long periods of physical inactivity. This continuity in physical
activity is crucial, as it helps prevent weight gain, which is a significant risk factor for
SVD [2,4, 16]. Surgery is generally advised against in such cases [8]. Therefore, it is crucial to disseminate and promote conservative treatment alternatives to prevent the need for
surgical interventions whenever possible [46].

As there is a systematic review of conservative treatment in heel pain, this shows
us other types of conservative treatment with moderate evidence, such as low-level laser
therapy, dry-needling of lower leg and foot muscle trigger points, and calcaneal taping, as


J. Clin. Med. 2024, 13, 1391
11 of 13
well as high-quality evidence that ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency achieves heel
pain reduction [49]. This may pave the way for new research into conservative treatment
in SVD.

SVD is closely related to Osgood–Schlatter disease [50] (the onset of a traction apophysi-
tis as a consequence of repeated contractions of the femoral rectum part of the quadri-
ceps [51]), since one of its risk factors is having SVD [52]. Some treatments of both coincide, since Osgood–Schlatter is also treated with the decrease of physical activity [53,54], the
application of cold presses [55], physical therapy [56,57] and stretching [14, 56,58,59]. Also, treatment includes a good warm-up before activity and cool-down after it [60], as well as
knee orthoses [55].

This systematic review is a pioneering work in analyzing the effects of different con-
servative treatment methods for SVD. Among the study’s limitations, it is important for
the authors to acknowledge the absence of subgroup analyses based on sex and age. Ad-
ditionally, due to the high heterogeneity of the studies included, it was not possible to
conduct a consolidated quantitative analysis of the results through a meta-analysis. Conse-
quently, further research is recommended to compare the effects of various interventions
and develop specific treatment protocols for SVD.

5. Conclusions
Conservative interventions, such as the use of insoles, physical therapy, and Kinesio
taping, seem to have a positive effect in reducing pain and improving functionality in
patients with SVD. In addition, the disease seems to affect more men than women. The
findings of this research can be valuable for healthcare professionals, enabling them to
optimize the effectiveness of their clinical interventions and, consequently, mitigate the
significant socio-economic impact that SVD has on children and adolescents.
