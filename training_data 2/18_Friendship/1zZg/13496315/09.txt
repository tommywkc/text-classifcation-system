Abstract
Friendships are beneficial to a person's growth and well-being. People in close relationships may experience four types of self-change: self-expansion, self-pruning, self-contraction, and self-adulteration. The current cross-sectional research sought to investigate whether these relational self-change processes explain the links between friendship quality and well-being in same-sex best friendships. Study 1A (N = 187) adapted the Turkish Relational Self-Change Scale to the friendship context and confirmed its psychometric adequacy in addressing friendship-based self-changes in Türkiye. Study 1B (N = 306) examined the links between different friendship functions and relational self-changes, as well as whether relational self-changes explain the link between friendship quality and ontological well-being. Among the specific friendship functions, stimulating companionship and self-validation were related to self-expansion and self-pruning, whereas reliable alliance was related to self-contraction and self-adulteration. Self-adulteration also indirectly explained the relationship between friendship quality and ontological well-being. Study 2 (N = 204) revealed that only self-pruning explained the link between perceived friend responsiveness and overall well-being. The contributions of friendships to self-change and personal well-being were discussed in light of the findings.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to the World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017–2020), over 95% of participants from all ages and socioeconomic groups placed a high value on friendships in their lives across both individualistic and collectivistic cultures (Haerpfer et al., 2022). Friends, by providing support and understanding and sharing resources, act as our “chosen family” (Anderson & Chen, 2002) and affect how we perceive ourselves and our lives (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Extant research revealed that many friendship indices (e.g., number of friends, friendship satisfaction) have critical implications for individuals' well-being (Demir, Orthel, & Andelin, 2013). This effect might be evident because friends encourage individuals to progress toward their ideal selves by affirming their current self-aspects and providing opportunities for personal growth (Aron et al., 2022; Mattingly et al., 2020). Yet, the changes that might occur in individuals' self-concepts due to their friendships might be for better or worse (Slotter & Gardner, 2011), depending on the friendship quality (Cheung & Gardner, 2016). The two-dimensional relational self-change model (Mattingly et al., 2014, 2020) explains these positive and negative self-concept changes situated along two dimensions: valence and direction. Valence refers to whether changes occur in positive or negative self-concept content, and direction refers to whether these changes correspond to gains or losses in self-concept content. Self-expansion (i.e., increases in one's positive self-concept content) and self-pruning (i.e., decreases in one's negative self-concept content) are desirable self-change outcomes. On the contrary, self-contraction (i.e., decreases in one's positive self-concept content) and self-adulteration (i.e., increases in one's negative self-concept content) are undesirable self-change outcomes.

Despite the potential of friendships in accounting for self-changes (Richman et al., 2015; Slotter & Gardner, 2011), the two-dimensional relational self-change model has been broadly verified in the context of romantic relationships (e.g., Ma & Clark, 2021; McIntyre et al., 2015, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this model has not yet been tested in friendships. Additionally, little is known about the relationship between friendship-based self-changes and well-being. The present research aimed to examine whether friendship-based self-change explains the links between friendship quality and well-being in same-sex best friendships.

In Study 1A, we tested the psychometric qualities of the Turkish Relational Self-Change Scale in the friendship context. This scale was originally developed to assess self-change in romantic relationships in the USA based on the two-dimensional relational self-change model (Mattingly et al., 2014), and adapted to Turkish by Dincer et al. (2018). We aimed to adapt this Turkish form to the friendship context for use in our subsequent studies evaluating friendship-based self-changes. The quality of a friendship rests on its ability to serve various functions, including stimulation, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation, and emotional security (Mendelson & Aboud, 1999). In Study 1B, we first explored the associations between these friendship functions and friendship-based self-change patterns. In line with our primary goal in this research, we also examined whether the link between general friendship quality and well-being was explained by friendship-based self-changes. Among various well-being types, we assessed ontological well-being – feelings of contentment with one's life project (Şimşek, 2009) – as our dependent variable. Study 2 was designed as a conceptual replication of Study 1B. In this study, perceived friend responsiveness was taken as an alternative indicator of friendship quality, and we used a more comprehensive well-being measure (Butler & Kern, 2016) that combines the affective, psychological, and social aspects of flourishing (Seligman, 2011). We tested the indirect roles of relational self-change processes in explaining the relationship between perceived friend responsiveness and well-being.

Testing the two-dimensional relational self-change model in close friendships and understanding the association between perceived self-changes in friendships and feelings of well-being are critical. Desirable and undesirable self-change outcomes may help distinguish between true versus false friends. Friendships are not always rosy; wrongdoings, conflicts, emerging rivalries, or demands in companionships may elicit feelings of hurt and disappointment and threaten one's sense of self-worth (Rawlins, 2017). Maladaptive self-change outcomes within friendships (i.e., self-contraction, self-adulteration) might be regarded as red flags, and learning whether these types of undesirable self-change are associated with deteriorations in one's well-being might lead people to reconsider their unhealthy friendships. On the contrary, friendship-based positive self-change patterns (i.e., self-expansion, self-pruning) can be seen as green flags and a sign of healthy companionships, which are crucial for individuals to achieve their best possible selves (Slotter & Gardner, 2011). Next, we discuss our main study variables and clarify the theoretical basis of our research.

1.1 Well-being: Its dimensions and features
Research on well-being has revealed two main perspectives (Ryan & Deci, 2001). The first perspective is hedonism, which focuses on happiness and equates well-being with avoiding pain and attaining pleasure. In this tradition, subjective well-being is considered a common measure of well-being composed of three components: life satisfaction, positive mood, and the absence of negative mood (Diener & Lucas, 1999). Life satisfaction, the overall judgment of individuals about their “whole life,” refers to the cognitive element in subjective well-being, whereas positive and negative moods constitute the affective dimension. Even though subjective well-being is theoretically defined as one's cognitions and emotions about life, life satisfaction has the whole life as a clear referent, whereas its affective component yields a context-free evaluation of happiness, that is, without directly referring to life itself. Given the absence of a unifying basis in combining these two components, Şimşek (2009) has suggested a novel conceptualization for subjective well-being, called ontological well-being. The concept of “goal” has been taken as a bridging concept in evaluating the whole life both cognitively and affectively. Ontological well-being is formulated as individuals' evaluation of their personal “life project” from past to present. On the basis of the whole-time perspective, ontological well-being can be defined as a combination of contentment with one's past, reflection that one's present is aligned with one's life goals, and optimism about one's future. Ontological well-being is closely related to existential terms such as meaning in life, flourishing, or need for purpose. However, Şimşek (2009) has defined the concept in a purely phenomenological way based on individuals' subjective feelings about the extent to which their life mission is achieved.

The second perspective is eudemonia, emphasizing meaning, human growth, and self-realization. It specifically defines well-being as the degree to which one is fulfilling one's potential. Human flourishing requires exerting effort, sometimes at the cost of immediate happiness or pleasure (Ryan & Deci, 2001). The eudemonic tradition distinguished psychological well-being from subjective well-being. Ryff and Keyes (1995) conceptualized psychological well-being based on six dimensions: self-direction, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, self-acceptance, and positive relationships.

In integrating the hedonic and eudemonic perspectives, Seligman (2011) has developed his unique well-being model and pinpointed five pillars of optimal human functioning: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment—the abbreviation PERMA stands for these elements. Positive emotions are a hedonic route to happiness. Engagement is the flow experience resulting from using one's talents and capacity for adequately challenging tasks. Relationships correspond to feeling satisfied with one's interpersonal connections. Meaning is feeling that one's life is aligned with a greater purpose. Accomplishment refers to a sense of achievement and competence in pursuing goals. This model focuses on the affective, social, and psychological components of well-being in construing flourishing (Keyes, 2002).

Ontological well-being (Study 1B) and PERMA-based well-being (Study 2) were addressed as the primary outcome variables in the present research. Social relationships (including friendships) are considered as one of the principal determinants of well-being, along with financial status, health, and employment (Fleche et al., 2011). We focused on understanding how friendships contribute to well-being.

1.2 Conceptualizing friendships
Friendship can be defined as a voluntary relationship between two persons with varying degrees and kinds of companionship, affection, and mutual support (Hays, 1988). Individuals have an average of three to five friends, and each friendship can be classified as best, close, or casual depending on the degree of intimacy between friends (Demir & Özdemir, 2010; Mendelson & Aboud, 2012). The current research focused on individuals' relationship quality with their same-sex best friends.

Friendship quality can be assessed regarding specific friendship functions (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985), given that friends provide different types of socio-emotional and instrumental support (Asher & Parker, 1989). Mendelson and Aboud (1999) identified six different friendship functions: (a) stimulating companionship as doing fun and pleasurable things with a friend; (b) help as lending a helping hand when a friend is in need; (c) intimacy as showing empathy for a friend's affective states and being willing to listen to their inmost thoughts and feelings; (d) reliable alliance as being faithful and available in tough times; (e) self-validation as helping a friend build and maintain a more positive self-image; and (f) emotional security as soothing or providing comfort in unusual or frightening situations. Participants' scores on these features can be examined individually (e.g., Demir et al., 2007), or a composite score can be calculated, indicating general friendship quality (e.g., Bagwell et al., 2005; Demir et al., 2012). We adopted this function-based approach in addressing friendship quality in Study 1B.

In addition to overall friendship quality, friendships can be evaluated based on particular relationship experiences, such as social support (e.g., Cobo-Rendón et al., 2020), perceived mattering (Demir, Özen, et al., 2011), or autonomy support (e.g., Demir, Özdemir, & Marum, 2011). Perceived partner responsiveness has also been suggested as another indicator of high-quality social relationships (Selcuk et al., 2018). It has three key elements (Reis, 2014; Reis & Gable, 2015): (a) understanding, which is truly knowing a partner's core aspects (e.g., traits, feelings, or values); (b) validating, which is appreciating a partner's true self as it is; and (c) caring, which is giving close attention to a partner's immediate needs and well-being. The term can be applied to all close social bonds, including parenting, romantic relationships, and friendships (Selcuk et al., 2018). Perceived friend responsiveness can be re-conceptualized as a relational characteristic that combines the help, intimacy, self-validation, and emotional security functions suggested by Mendelson and Aboud (1999). In Study 2, we examined perceived friend responsiveness as an alternate proxy for friendship quality.

1.3 Friendship quality and well-being
Friendships are essential to individuals' healthy psychosocial functioning (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Fleche et al., 2011). There has been research that show the link between general friendship quality and numerous well-being indicators, such as happiness (Demir et al., 2007), eudemonic well-being (Bakalım & Taşdelen-Karçkay, 2016), self-esteem, and decreased mental health symptomology (Bagwell et al., 2005; Camirand & Poulin, 2022). When multiple friendships were studied simultaneously, best friends (compared to close friends) were identified as the most important source of happiness (Demir et al., 2007). Specific friendship characteristics, such as companionship, self-validation (Demir et al., 2007), and satisfaction (Diener & Seligman, 2002) were also found to be associated with happiness. Similarly, perceived friend responsiveness was positively correlated with psychological well-being (Taşfiliz et al., 2020) and happiness (Demir & Davidson, 2013).

The questions of how and through which mechanisms positive friendship experiences are related to psychological functioning have yet to be fully answered (Demir, Orthel, & Andelin, 2013). In one study by Bakalım and Taşdelen-Karçkay (2016), friendship security yielded an indirect effect on psychological well-being through social support. Need satisfaction (Demir & Özdemir, 2010), perceived mattering (Demir, Özen et al., 2011), and feelings of personal uniqueness (Demir, Şimşek, & Procsal, 2013) also indirectly explained the relationship between friendship quality and happiness. Alternatively, in this research, we tested relational self-change as another indirect mechanism accounting for the link between friendship quality and well-being.

1.4 Self-change in relationships and its link to well-being
Self-growth, which refers to a person's positive self-change (Jain et al., 2015), is defined as building personal skills, setting and pursuing specific goals, adding new positive traits, perspectives, and resources to one's self-concept, and becoming increasingly efficacious over the life span (Aron et al., 2022). Even though self-growth is a personal journey, it intricately depends on interpersonal relationships (Jakubiak & Tomlinson, 2020). One theoretical approach highlighting the role of interpersonal relationships on self-development is the self-expansion model (Aron et al., 2013). According to this approach, people are motivated to raise their self-efficacy by obtaining new perspectives, developing new abilities, and forming new identities that will help them achieve their future goals. To this end, individuals follow personal pursuits (Mattingly & Lewandowski Jr., 2014) or form close relationships (Aron et al., 2013). In intimate relationships, people expand and diversify their self-concepts by including close others and their resources in their self-concepts (Aron et al., 2004). Doing novel and interesting activities with one's partner also contributes to self-expansion (Graham & Harf, 2015), as those novel experiences might turn into newly acquired identities (Mattingly & Lewandowski Jr., 2014). Individuals can help their partners to continuously expand their selves in a myriad of other ways, such as offering new perspectives, providing physical, financial, or social support in pursuing their goals, or presenting active assistance like teaching new skills (Aron et al., 2000).

The augmented self-concept described in the self-expansion model is typically positive. However, it is also likely that people undergo negative self-concept changes in their relationships. For example, individuals might stop engaging in previous hobbies during their relationships (Lewandowski Jr. & Bizzoco, 2007) or lose their overall trust following infidelity (Jones et al., 1997); these circumstances can reduce positive self-concept content. The two-dimensional model of relational self-change developed by Mattingly et al. (2014) suggests that there are four main self-changes that people can go through in romantic relationships (see Figure 1). According to this approach, self-concept change takes place along two dimensions: valence and direction. The valence refers to whether the change occurs in positive or negative self-content, whereas the direction is associated with whether self-change content indicates a gain or loss. An increase in positive self-concept content is called self-expansion (e.g., a partner interested in arts and literature might help individuals discover their unnoticed writing talent, leading them to develop the identity of a writer). A reduction in positive self-concept content is termed self-contraction (e.g., a controlling partner might cause individuals to lose their sense of autonomy). A decrease in negatively valenced self-concept content denotes self-pruning (e.g., a supportive partner might help individuals break their unwanted habits, such as smoking or eating unhealthy foods). Lastly, an addition or augmentation of negative attributes into the self-concept is named self-adulteration (e.g., an overly critical relationship may cause individuals to internalize and undertake negative traits by incorporating their partners' depreciating remarks into their self-concept).

Two-dimensional model of relational self-change.
In line with the Michelangelo phenomenon (Drigotas et al., 1999; Rusbult et al., 2005, 2009), a partner may attempt to shape individuals' self-concept toward their ideal self by augmenting favorable features (i.e., self-expansion) or removing undesirable qualities from their self-concept (i.e., self-pruning). Both self-expansion and self-pruning are desirable relational processes since the overall positivity of self-concept increases, and these two processes demonstrated moderate to high bivariate correlations (Dincer et al., 2018; Ma & Clark, 2021; McIntyre et al., 2015). Relatedly, Mattingly et al. (2020) retitled these self-change outcomes as improvement processes. These improvement-driven self-processes were found to be associated with many positive outcomes, such as self-concept clarity (Lewandowski Jr. et al., 2010), authenticity (DiDonato & Krueger, 2010), self-esteem, self-efficacy (Mattingly & Lewandowski Jr., 2013), personal growth (Drigotas, 2002), decreases in depressive symptoms (McIntyre et al., 2023), heightened positive affect (Strong & Aron, 2006), greater inclusion of the partner in the self (Dincer et al., 2018), relationship satisfaction, and commitment (Mattingly et al., 2014; McIntyre et al., 2015).

Self-contraction and self-adulteration, on the other hand, are considered degradation processes since they reduce the overall positivity of people's self-concept (Mattingly et al., 2020); hence, the two yielded positive bivariate relationships in empirical studies (e.g., Dincer et al., 2018; Ma & Clark, 2021; McIntyre et al., 2015). These aggravating processes involve moving away from an individual's ideal self by diminishing positive self-content or escalating undesirable attributes (Mattingly et al., 2014). As a result, individuals may have impairments in their self-concepts in terms of both content and clarity (Lewandowski Jr. et al., 2006; Slotter et al., 2010), as well as higher levels of emotional distress (Slotter et al., 2010), which may have an adverse effect on their psychological well-being (McIntyre et al., 2015) and lead to negative interpersonal outcomes such as relationship dissatisfaction, betrayal, and dissolution (Mattingly et al., 2014; McIntyre et al., 2015).

1.5 The current research
High-quality close relationships improve people's well-being (Feeney & Collins, 2015). This association might be related to the fact that close relationships have a significant impact on individuals' self-concepts (Mattingly et al., 2020). As discussed above, people in close relationships can experience significant changes in the size, structure, and diversity of their self-concepts, either positively or negatively. Some self-concept changes can assist individuals in becoming more like their ideal selves, thereby increasing their subjective, psychological, and social well-being. Within this approach, we investigated the indirect effect of relational self-change in friendships on the link between friendship quality and well-being in the current study.

We based our predictions on the two-dimensional relational self-change model (Mattingly et al., 2014). Although this model primarily focuses on romantic relationships, people are likely to experience similar self-changes in their friendships (Richman et al., 2015). For example, a stimulating companionship can bolster self-expansion as sharing novel and fun activities with friends might help individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves (Gordon & Luo, 2011) and acquire novel identities (Mattingly & Lewandowski Jr., 2014). In addition, emotional security in friendships might encourage individuals to accept and persist through challenging opportunities that are conducive to their personal development. Schnall et al. (2008) provide compelling empirical evidence that people perceived a hill as less steep when they were with or thought of their friends rather than when they were alone or imagined an antipathetic or neutral person. Moreover, individuals who have friends that validate their actual selves are less likely to suffer self-esteem loss as a result of a personal failure (Caprariello & Reis, 2011). In this regard, the friendship functions of intimacy, support, reliable alliance, self-validation, emotional security, or responsiveness in a broader sense appear to make people more open to learning about their flaws (Kumashiro & Sedikides, 2005), which might facilitate progress toward their ideal self through increased self-expansion and self-pruning and decreased self-adulteration. High-quality friendships may also prevent people from self-contraction, because a friend's confirmation of one's preferred qualities can help people keep their brightest sides and live up to their potential (Anderson & Fowers, 2020; Selcuk et al., 2018).

One of the main goals of the current research was to probe the indirect roles of friendship-based self-changes in the well-established link between friendship quality and well-being (Demir, Orthel, & Andelin, 2013). Facilitating this investigation, in Study 1A, we adapted the Turkish Relational Self-Change Scale ([RSCS] Dincer et al., 2018) to the friendship context. In questioning its psychometric soundness in this novel relational setting, our ultimate goal was to put forward the Relational Self-Change Scale-Friendships (RSCS-F) for addressing friendship-based self-change processes. More specifically, Study 1A aimed to question whether the scale represents the model's underlying four-factorial structure and has acceptable reliabilities when used to examine self-changes experienced in same-sex best friendships. Also, we examined the scale's convergent validity. In doing so, we first questioned the associations among the RSCS-F subscales. Given that self-expansion and self-pruning are experienced as desirable self-change outcomes, whereas self-contraction and self-adulteration as undesirable ones (Mattingly et al., 2020), these positive and negative self-change outcomes were hypothesized to be positively correlated within themselves (Hypothesis 1). We secondly questioned the relationships of four friendship-based self-change mechanisms with three different variables, namely, the inclusion of the best friend into the self, self-compassion, and personal sense of uniqueness. As the inclusion of others into the self is an integral part of the self-expansion process (Aron et al., 1992), friendship-based self-expansion was expected to be positively associated with a sense of oneness with the best friend (Hypothesis 2). Self-compassion is adopting compassionate attitudes toward oneself in experiencing personal failures (Neff, 2003). Given that responsive partners foster positive attitudes toward the self (Shaver et al., 2017), and there is a close association between positive friendship qualities and self-compassion (Lathren et al., 2021), we expected to observe that self-compassion would demonstrate positive correlations with positive self-change processes and negative correlations with negative self-change processes (Hypothesis 3). Uniqueness is a person's feelings of self-worth just because of who they are (Şimşek & Yalınçetin, 2010). It is closely linked to self-growth as achieving individuality and appreciating one's inherent worth increases a person's capability to live a happy life (Rogers, 1961). Given that good friendships might bolster the unique characteristics of individuals (Demir, Şimşek, & Procsal, 2013), a personal sense of uniqueness was expected to be positively associated with desirable self-change patterns and negatively with undesirable ones (Hypothesis 4).

Study 1B first explored how different friendship functions would be associated with four relational self-change outcomes in same-sex best friendships. To this end, the individual contributions of six friendship functions suggested by Mendelson and Aboud (1999) in explaining perceived self-changes were questioned. Because no previous research has addressed friendship-based relational self-changes, we were unable to make specific predictions about the relationship between distinct friendship functions and specific self-change types. As high-functioning friendships are conducive to individuals' progress toward their ideal selves (Mattingly et al., 2020) and might protect them from becoming their worst selves (Erdley & Day, 2017), we proposed friendship-based self-change as an indirect mechanism in explaining the link between friendship quality and ontological well-being. Relatedly, our second aim in Study 1B was to test our prediction that general friendship quality would be indirectly associated with ontological well-being through four relational self-change mechanisms (Hypothesis 5).

In Study 2, we examined the indirect effects of relational self-changes, this time focusing on a particular relationship characteristic—perceived friend responsiveness. We also used an alternative assessment of well-being based on the PERMA model combining the hedonic, social, and eudemonic well-being components. We hypothesized that self-change processes in same-sex best friendships would indirectly explain the relationship between perceived friend responsiveness and general well-being (Hypothesis 6).

The two-dimensional relational self-change model (Mattingly et al., 2014) has been mostly tested in WEIRD samples (Aron et al., 2022), which are drawn from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations (Henrich et al., 2010). A study by Dincer et al. (2018) confirmed the plausibility of this model in explaining relational self-changes in romantic relationships in Türkiye, a non-Western country. The current research also offers an important attempt to testing the relational self-change model in samples from Türkiye, but this time by addressing friendships. Valuing friendships was found to be more strongly associated with subjective well-being in countries with high-income disparity, individualism, uncertainty, and low indulgence (Lu et al., 2021). Türkiye can be said to be a unique context in addressing the link between friendships and well-being given that it is among the countries with the greatest levels of income inequality in the world (World Inequality Report, 2022), and Turkish people endorse both individualistic and collectivistic value orientations (Imamoğlu & Karakitapoğlu-Aygün, 1999; Kagitcibasi & Ataca, 2005).

2 STUDY 1A
2.1 Method
2.1.1 Participants
Our sample consisted of 187 Turkish college students (116 females and 71 men) recruited during the spring semester of 2022. This analysis set was created by excluding two people over the age of 50 during the data cleaning (based on an outlier analysis). The vast majority (76%) had majored in psychology, psychological counseling, and English-teaching departments in different cities, including Istanbul, Konya, and Ankara. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 37 (M = 21.73, SD = 2.52). They had a mean of 5.85 (SD = 1.58) on the 10-point perceived socioeconomic status scale (1 = the lowest income group; 10 = the highest income group).

2.1.2 Instruments
Relational self-change scale-friendships (RSCS-F)
The 12-item RSCS was developed to assess self-change in romantic relationships (Mattingly et al., 2014). It consists of four subscales: self-expansion (e.g., “I have added positive qualities to my sense of self.”), self-contraction (e.g., “My positive attributes have decreased.”), self-pruning (e.g., “My bad habits have diminished.”), and self-adulteration (e.g., “I have more negative qualities.”). In the original scale, participants are asked to evaluate their self-change by being with their romantic partner on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not very much; 7 = very much). The RSCS was adapted to Turkish by Dincer et al. (2018). We adapted this Turkish version to the friendship context by doing the following. First, we checked the appropriateness of item translations from English to Turkish in the Turkish RSCS. We decided to keep all Turkish translations as they were, except for one item (Item 10) yielding relatively low factor loading in the adaptation study. We re-translated this item by a forward-translation method (Gregoire, 2018) to improve its soundness in Turkish. Second, we changed the scale instruction to address friendship-based self-changes. The items are preceded by the statement “By being with my romantic partner…” in the original form. We changed this statement to “By being with my best friend…,” and participants were instructed to evaluate their self-change in their same-sex best friendships. We retained the 7-point Likert scale as in the original RSCS.

Inclusion of other into the self (IOS) scale
A one-item pictorial IOS scale (Aron et al., 1992) was used to determine the degree of participants' self-other overlap with their best friends. They were given a set of 7-paired circles. In each pair, one circle was said to stand for one's self and the other for one's best friend. The degree of overlap between circles ranged between 1 (no overlap) and 7 (nearly complete overlap), where higher overlap scores indicated greater closeness between the self and one's best friend.

Self-compassion scale – short form
We used the self-compassion scale originally developed by Neff (2003), later shortened by Raes et al. (2011), and adapted to Turkish by Akça (2014) to measure participants' self-compassion levels. Participants were asked to respond to 12 behavioral items (e.g., “I try to see my failings as part of the human condition.”) on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = almost never; 5 = almost always). Increasing scores on the scale (ω = .85) indicated higher self-compassion levels.

Personal sense of uniqueness scale
The Personal Sense of Uniqueness Scale (Şimşek & Yalınçetin, 2010) was used in measuring people's sense of uniqueness levels. The scale consists of five items (e.g., “I feel that some of my characteristics are completely unique to me.”), rated through a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores on the total scale (ω = .70) indicated greater uniqueness levels.

2.1.3 Procedure
Ethics approval was obtained from a national ethics committee. An online survey tool was used to collect the data. The study link was administered to students via class interaction channels, such as email groups, online announcement systems, or class Whatsapp groups. Participants were required to respond to the survey individually (on their smartphones or computers). Students who were eligible to participate were those who were enrolled in the authors' or their colleagues' classes in various universities. After providing their informed consent, participants completed the self-compassion and uniqueness scales. Next, a formal definition of the term friend was provided to clarify its meaning. Participants were reminded that friends had no blood ties or sexual relations. After that, participants were asked to think (of one) of their same-sex best or closest friends and completed the IOS and RSCS-F scales by considering this particular friend of theirs. Participants gained extra course credit for their participation.

2.1.4 Data analysis
Prior to the planned statistical analysis, data cleaning was performed. There was no missing data because survey participants were instantly notified when a question was left blank. There was no evidence of dubious or suspicious data. The plausibility of the four-factorial structure for RSCS-F was tested with Confirmatory Factor Analysis using AMOS 23.0. We evaluated model fit based on the following indices (Goodboy & Kline, 2017; Kline, 2023; West et al., 2023): CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR. We adopted the cutoff values proposed by Hu and Bentler (1999). The model was assumed to have a good fit when CFI and TLI are higher than .95, RMSEA is lower than .06, and SRMR is lower than .08. Inter-item reliability was evaluated using McDonald's omega. Convergent validity was tested by inspecting the bivariate relationships between the RSCS-F subscales (Hypothesis 1) and their associations with IOS, self-compassion, and a personal sense of uniqueness (Hypothesis 2, 3, 4) through Pearson's correlation coefficient. We evaluated the scale reliability and convergent validity using SPSS 23.0.

2.2 Results and discussion
2.2.1 Factorial structure of the RSCS-F
The first-order four factorial structure fitted the data acceptably (χ2(48, N = 187) = 109.75, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.29, CFI = .941, TLI = .918, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .075). By adding an error covariance between the two items of the self-contraction dimension, we obtained the following fit indices: χ2(47, N = 187) = 98.18, p < .001, χ2/df = 2.09, CFI = .951, TLI = .931, RMSEA = .077, SRMR = .073. The chi-square difference test indicated a statistically significant improvement in the model (Δ χ2 (1, N = 187) = 11.57, p < .001). The results suggested that the original four-factorial RSCS structure also held for the friendship context. The standardized factor loadings are included in Figure 2.

2.2.2 Reliability of the RSCS-F subscales
McDonald's omega was .79 for self-expansion, .70 for self-contraction, .88 for self-pruning, and .70 for self-adulteration, indicating moderate to good internal consistencies (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).

2.2.3 Convergent validity of the RSCS-F
The inter-correlations among the RSCS-F subscales and their relations to certain demographics and validation scales are presented in Table 1. There was a positive correlation between self-expansion and self-pruning and between self-contraction and self-adulteration, confirming Hypothesis 1. It seems that individuals experience the former two as positive self-change outcomes and the latter two as negative outcomes in their friendships. Males reported greater levels of self-contraction and self-adulteration than females.

* p < .05;
** p < .01.
In support of Hypothesis 2, greater IOS levels was associated with higher self-expansion and self-pruning. As one major route to self-expansion is including one's partner's psychosocial resources (e.g., identities, skills, or perspectives) in the self (Aron et al., 2022), it is understandable to observe a positive association between self-expansion and IOS. The cognitive sense of oneness with a best friend was also associated with self-pruning. Including one close other's resources and positive qualities in the self might help individuals more easily subtract negative content from their self-concepts given that people become more eager to accept themselves and embrace their weaknesses in nurturing relationships (Shaver et al., 2017).

Providing partial support for Hypothesis 3, self-compassion was positively associated with self-pruning and negatively associated with self-contraction. This finding might refer to the fact that people who achieve to decrease the distance between their existing and undesired selves through self-pruning might more easily integrate their weaknesses and failures into their selves and thus become more compassionate toward themselves. Alternatively, as self-compassion improves self-improvement motivation after making mistakes (Breines & Chen, 2012), self-compassionate individuals might better take advantage of their nurturing friendships in pruning their negative qualities. These arguments might imply a bi-directional association between self-compassion and self-pruning, calling for prospective longitudinal studies. On the contrary, contracting in terms of positive self-concept content or losing existing positive qualities due to their friendships might be so frustrating for people that they cannot sustain a balanced approach to their failures or painful experiences. Yet, given that the absolute values of rs representing the correlations between self-compassion and different self-change forms ranged from .11 to .20, future studies with larger samples might yield statistically significant findings about the link between self-compassion and the remaining self-change processes.

The personal sense of uniqueness was positively correlated with self-expansion and negatively correlated with self-contraction and self-adulteration. These findings largely supported Hypothesis 4. Unexpectedly, losing undesirable self-concept content was unrelated to individuals' seeing themselves as distinct from others. This might reflect the possibility that self-pruning is more closely linked with changes toward the ought self than those toward the ideal self, given that people refrain from negative distinctions from others in pursuing their ought self-guides (i.e., obligations and duties) while striving for positive distinctions in pursuing their ideal self-guides (i.e., ideals and aspirations; Hall et al., 2015). Future research could examine which relational self-change mechanisms serve to achieve what type of personal standards.

In sum, the RSCS-F subscales were positively associated with each other within positive and negative self-change domains, and our expectations about their relationships with other theoretically relevant constructs were mostly confirmed. Thus, the results can be concluded to support RSCS-F's convergent validity.

3 STUDY 1B
Study 1A established that the RSCS-F is a reliable and valid tool for addressing different relational self-change outcomes in same-sex best friendships. In Study 1B, we explored how different friendship functions would be associated with perceived self-changes in friendships and tested our prediction about the indirect roles of those self-changes on the link between friendship quality and ontological well-being (Hypothesis 5).

3.1 Method
3.1.1 Participants and procedure
The study included 306 Turkish college students (220 females and 86 males) recruited during the spring term of 2022. Our analysis set was constructed by eliminating three persons aged 42, 51, and 53 based on an outlier analysis. Over 85% were students in preschool teaching and psychology departments in Istanbul and Izmir. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 35 (M = 21.40, SD = 2.28). They had a mean of 5.43 (SD = 1.59) on the 10-point perceived socioeconomic status scale. Following ethics approval, the same data collection approach as in Study 1A was carried out.

3.1.2 Instruments
McGill friendship questionnaire-friendship functions
This scale was developed by Mendelson and Aboud (1999) to determine participants' friendship quality with their best friend by considering six friendship functions: stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation, and emotional security. The scale consists of 30 items (e.g., “My best friend is someone I can tell private things to”), rated through 9-point Likert scales (0 = never; 8 = always). The scale was translated to Turkish by Özen et al. (2011). The McDonald's omega was .97 for the total scale, and it ranged from.88 to .93 for the specific friendship functions.

Relational self-change scale-friendships
Participants' self-changes in their same-sex best friendships were assessed through the RSCS-F adapted in Study 1A. The McDonald's omega was .83 for self-expansion, .70 for self-contraction, .86 for self-pruning, and .76 for self-adulteration.

Ontological well-being scale (the life project scale)
This scale was developed by Şimşek and Kocayörük (2013) to address people's evaluation of their life project regarding its past, present, and future. Participants are given a set of specific emotional reactions (e.g., helpless, confident, upset, or tired) and asked to evaluate their past (the “completed” part of their life project), present (the “ongoing” part of their life project), and future (the “upcoming” part of their life project) on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very slightly or not at all; 5 = extremely). Higher scores on the scale (ω = .93) were associated with greater levels of ontological well-being.

3.1.3 Data analysis
A set of hierarchical regression analyses was conducted to explore the effects of different friendship functions in accounting for various self-change outcomes. The SPSS PROCESS Macro (Model 4; Hayes, 2017) was used to test our hypothesis about the indirect roles of those self-change processes on the link between general friendship quality and ontological well-being. None of the VIF values exceeded a threshold of 5 (James et al., 2013), and all tolerance values were above .10 (Hair et al., 2019), indicating that multicollinearity was not an issue in any of our regression-based analyses.

3.2 Results
Table 2 includes the descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations among the study variables. Due to their significant associations with the mediator and dependent variables, the three demographic variables (i.e., sex, perceived socioeconomic status, and friendship length) were controlled for in further analyses.

3.2.1 Exploratory analyses: Associations of friendship functions with relational self-change patterns
Our research question aimed to examine which specific friendship functions might have played a role in predicting different self-change experiences. We conducted four separate two-step hierarchical regression analyses by specifying the four types of self-change as the dependent variables. For our independent variables, we entered the three control variables in the first step and the six friendship functions in the second. The results of these exploratory analyses are summarized in Table 3.

The total model was statistically significant in explaining self-expansion, self-contraction, self-pruning, and self-adulteration at an alpha level of .001. The friendship functions of stimulating companionship (p < .001), help (p = .040), intimacy (p = .047), self-validation (p = .001), and emotional security (p = .011) were significantly associated with self-expansion. Yet, the positive bivariate association between the intimacy function and self-expansion became negative when including other variables in the regression model, suggesting a possible suppression effect. To obtain more interpretable results, we created a combined score based on the intimacy, reliable alliance, and emotional security scores, as the latter two were strongly correlated with the former, with rs approaching .80. We called this composite variable “emotional support,” as the three friendship functions seemed to refer to perceptions about the emotional availability of friends in people's bad times. We re-tested the same hierarchical regression model for self-expansion, using this combined score with the remaining three friendship functions as our independent variables in the second step. The revised model was statistically significant (F(7, 298) = 31.00, p < .001, R2 = .42) and free of a suppression effect; stimulating companionship (B = .32, SE = .06, β = .34, p < .001), help (B = .20, SE = .08, β = .20, p = .008), and self-validation (B = .24, SE = .06, β = .27, p < .001) yielded significant positive associations with self-expansion. Yet, “emotional support” was not associated with self-expansion (B = −.11, SE = .10, β = −.11, p = .244). In addition, stimulating companionship (p < .001) and self-validation (p = .009) demonstrated positive associations with self-pruning. Among six functions, only reliable alliance was negatively associated with self-contraction (p = .010) and self-adulteration (p = .001).

All friendship functions were correlated with all four relational self-changes at the bivariate level. Yet, when all friendship functions were modeled in the same regression model with a set of demographic variables to explain perceived relational self-change mechanisms, stimulating companionship, help, and self-validation showed the strongest associations with self-expansion. Among the three, stimulating companionship and self-validation also yielded significant relationships with self-pruning. Only reliable alliance was associated with self-contraction and self-adulteration.

3.2.2 Hypothesis testing: The mediatory role of relational self-change
We predicted that friendship quality would be indirectly associated with ontological well-being through friendship-based self-changes (Hypothesis 5). Rather than using separate friendship functions, we computed a composite friendship quality score by averaging the friendship functions in our analysis. This general quality score was included in the mediation model as the independent variable, the four self-change scores as the mediator variables, and the ontological well-being score as the dependent variable. In addition, the three demographic variables were controlled.

Friendship quality was positively associated with self-expansion (B = .64, SE = .05, p < .001) and self-pruning (B = .63, SE = .09, p < .001) and negatively associated with self-contraction (B = −.24, SE = .08, p = .002) and self-adulteration (B = −.29, SE = .07, p < .001). Self-expansion (B = .09, SE = .06, p = .147) and self-contraction (B = −.02, SE = .05, p = .637) were not related to ontological well-being. Yet, while self-pruning was positively associated with ontological well-being (B = .09, SE = .04, p = .024), self-adulteration was negatively associated with it (B = −.13, SE = .05, p = .012). The direct relationship between friendship quality and ontological well-being was statistically significant, B = .17, SE = .06, p = .002. Yet, with the inclusion of the control and mediator variables, this relationship became nonsignificant, B = .01, SE = .07, p = .878. The indirect effect of self-adulteration (B = .04, SE = .02, 95% CI [.00, .09]) on the link between friendship quality and ontological well-being was statistically significant. In contrast, the indirect effects concerning self-expansion (B = .06, SE = .04, 95% CI [−.03, .14]), self-contraction (B = .01, SE = .01, 95% CI [−.02, .04]), and self-pruning (B = .06, SE = .03, 95% CI [−.00, .13]) were not statistically significant. The full model explained 12% of the variance in ontological well-being. The standardized path coefficients are included in Figure 3.

These results provided partial support for our fifth hypothesis concerning the indirect effects of relational self-changes. While self-adulteration played an indirect role in linking friendship quality to ontological well-being, the indirect roles of the remaining self-change mechanisms in this association were not confirmed.

4 STUDY 2
Study 1B demonstrated that high-quality friendships are related to individuals' ontological well-being through the indirect effect of self-adulteration. We aimed to replicate the indirect roles of friendship-based self-changes in same-sex best friendships in Study 2 (Hypothesis 6), but this time by using perceived best friend responsiveness as a novel proxy for friendship quality and using a more comprehensive well-being measure (based on the PERMA model) as our dependent variable.

4.1 Method
4.1.1 Participants and procedure
Two hundred and four undergraduate students (132 females, 72 males) from Türkiye were recruited during the spring term of 2022. A majority of them had been majoring in either English teaching (16.2%) or psychology (62.3%) in Istanbul, Konya, and Ankara. Their ages ranged between 18 and 33 (M = 21.56, SD = 2.20). The mean of their perceived socioeconomic status on the 10-point scale was 5.50 (SD = 1.61). We followed the same data collection method as in Study 1A after getting ethics approval.

4.1.2 Instruments
Perceived partner responsiveness scale
This scale was developed by Reis et al. (2017) to assess the degree to which people perceive their close partners as responsive. It consists of 18 items (e.g., “…sees the real me”, “…really listens to me”), rated on 9-point Likert scales (1 = not at all true; 9 = completely true). The scale was adapted to Turkish by Taşfiliz et al. (2020) in the friendship context. We asked our participants to judge the responsiveness of their same-sex best friends by using this Turkish form. Higher scores (ω = .95) indicated greater perceived partner responsiveness.

Relational self-change scale-friendships
We used the Turkish RSCS-F adapted in Study 1A to assess participants' perceived self-changes in their same-sex best friendships. The McDonald's omega was .84 for self-expansion, .70 for self-contraction, .90 for self-pruning, and .61 for self-adulteration.

PERMA-profiler scale
This scale was developed by Butler and Kern (2016) to evaluate individuals' flourishing levels based on five well-being dimensions (i.e., Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) proposed by Seligman (2011). The shortened version consists of 15 items with three items for each well-being dimension. In addition, eight items were added to the scale to assess general happiness, negative emotions, loneliness, and physical health. All questions (e.g., “How often do you lose track of time while doing something you enjoy?”) were answered on a 11-point Likert scale. The Turkish version of the scale is valid and reliable (Demirci et al., 2017). A general well-being score (ω = .94) was calculated by taking the mean of the scores for the primary 15 items and one general happiness item in the present study. Higher scores indicated greater levels of well-being.

4.1.3 Data analysis
We tested our hypothesis using SPSS PROCESS macro (Model 4, Hayes, 2017).

4.2 Results and discussion
The descriptive statistics and the correlations among the study variables are presented in Table 4. We hypothesized that self-change processes would indirectly explain the relationship between perceived best friend responsiveness and general well-being. The model included perceived partner responsiveness as the independent variable, four self-change processes as mediators, and the PERMA score as the dependent variable. As sex, age, perceived socioeconomic status, and friendship length were significantly associated with relational self-change scores and well-being, these demographic variables were controlled for in testing the hypothesized mediation model. Perceived friend responsiveness was positively associated with self-expansion (B = .56, SE = .07, p < .001) and self-pruning (B = .57, SE = .09, p < .001) but negatively associated with self-contraction (B = −.25, SE = .07, p < .001) and self-adulteration (B = −.19, SE = .06, p = .001). Among the relational self-change dimensions, only self-pruning was significantly related to well-being (B = .25, SE = .09, p = .006). The remaining self-change outcomes, including self-expansion (B = .05, SE = .12, p = .637), self-contraction (B = −.09, SE = .11, p = .427), and self-adulteration (B = −.16, SE = .12, p = .201) did not yield significant relationships with participants' well-being levels. The relationship between partner responsiveness and well-being was statistically significant (B = .42, SE = .09, p < .001). This link became nonsignificant (B = .19, SE = .11, p = .088) when including the control and mediator variables in the same model. The indirect role of self-pruning in explaining the association between best friend responsiveness and well-being was statistically significant, B = .14, SE = .05, 95% CI [.05, .27]. The results did not provide empirical evidence for the indirect roles of self-expansion (B = .03, SE = .08, 95% CI [−.12, .17]), self-contraction (B = .02, SE = .03, 95% CI [−.03, .09]), and self-adulteration (B = .03, SE = .03, 95% CI [−.01, .09]). The full model explained 27% of the variance in the well-being scores. The standardized path coefficients are shown in Figure 4.

The results provided partial support for Hypothesis 6. The indirect role of relational self-change was confirmed for self-pruning, but not for the remaining self-change types.

5 DISCUSSION
We conducted three studies on relational self-changes in same-sex best friendships. In Study 1A, we investigated the two-dimensional relational self-change model in the friendship context in Türkiye in order to establish a new scale (RSCS-F) to measure friendship-based self-changes. We had two goals in Study 1B: (a) to explore which friendship functions were linked with relational self-change outcomes, and (b) to investigate the indirect roles of friendship-based relational self-changes in the relationship between friendship quality and ontological well-being. In Study 2, we sought conceptual replication by looking at the indirect effects of relational self-changes on the relationship between perceived friend responsiveness and overall well-being.

The Turkish RSCS-F, like the RSCS (Dincer et al., 2018; Mattingly et al., 2014), has a four-factorial structure, according to Study 1A. The RSCS-F subscales were found to be reliable. The RSCS-F subscales showed substantial correlations among themselves as well as with interpersonal closeness, self-compassion, and a personal sense of uniqueness, verifying our predictions (Hypotheses 1 to 4). Accordingly, the RSCS-F is a reliable and valid tool for evaluating the relational self-change dynamics in friendships in the Turkish cultural context. The newly adapted RSCS-F can be used to question the precursors and implications of friendship-based self-change in further studies.

In Study 1B, stimulating companionship and self-validation emerged as the primary correlates of friendship-based positive self-change outcomes (i.e., self-expansion and self-pruning). Similarly, the help function was also associated with self-expansion. People appear to discover previously unknown self-aspects, integrate them into their self-concept, and find the courage to embrace and work on their shortcomings in a stimulating, supportive, and responsive friendship environment, thereby progressing toward their ideal self via heightened self-expansion and self-pruning. Only reliable alliance demonstrated significant associations with self-adulteration and self-contraction. Anxiety over one's worth to relationship partners, which is common of insecurely attached persons, may prevent people from staying genuine to themselves (Gillath et al., 2010). Given that a friend's perceived loyalty is a reliable alliance (Mendelson & Aboud, 1999), the current findings may indicate that a loss of trust in friendships is the most significant reason behind relational self-degradation by losing positive self-content or escalating undesirable characteristics.

Our fifth and sixth hypotheses asserted that friendship quality would be indirectly associated with well-being through relational self-changes. The results partially confirmed this prediction. In Study 1B, self-adulteration played an indirect role in the link between general friendship quality and ontological well-being. In Study 2, self-pruning was found to be another indirect route in linking perceived friend responsiveness to general well-being (i.e., the PERMA measure). In the former study, relationship quality was examined on a functional basis, but in the latter, it was characterized as the degree to which a friend is responsive. In all of the studies, regardless of its different conceptualizations, friendship quality was connected with various types of self-changes. Yet, only self-pruning demonstrated a consistent relationship with well-being in subjective and psychological senses. Given that this self-process was significantly associated with ontological well-being (see Figure 3), and the lower end of the confidence interval for its indirect effect was close to zero, the failure to confirm the indirect role of self-pruning in Study 1B could be a statistical artifact. Recognizing and accepting responsibility for one's flaws is essential for living a more productive and meaningful life (Neff et al., 2007). Yet, people might need supportive and encouraging close relationships to accept and fix their harmful or unproductive behavior patterns without self-condemnation (Shaver et al., 2017). High-quality friendships can be said to facilitate successful self-pruning, which might, in turn, be conducive to flourishing. A look at Turkish proverbs may also help readers comprehend how Turkish people view friendship on a communal level. For example, “Dost dostun ayıbını yüzüne söyler.” (good friends tell their friends' mistakes to their faces), “Dostun attığı taş baş yarmaz.” (a stone thrown by a friend does not do harm), and “Dost acı söyler.” (a good friend will never sugarcoat the truth) are used to signify that a true friend should reveal their friends' problems honestly in order to warn them and remedy their flaws (Turkish Language Association, n.d.). These proverbs emphasize that telling a friend's undesirable characteristics to their face is in the friend's best interests and is a natural part of healthy friendships in Turkish culture. Within this cultural context, it is understandable why self-pruning in good friendships might provide pathways to a more fulfilling life.

Self-adulteration was another indirect mechanism in the relationship between friendship quality and ontological well-being. Self-adulteration works in the opposite direction of self-expansion and undermines personal growth by adding negative content to the self or revealing hidden negative aspects (Mattingly et al., 2014; McIntyre et al., 2015). Insufficient self-expansion in relationships hinders the satisfaction of self-growth motivation (Aron et al., 2004). The present finding about self-adulteration might indicate that high-functioning friendships help protect individuals from developing undesirable self-concept content, thereby assisting them in cultivating more positive evaluations about their life project regarding its past, present, and future. There are various Turkish variants of the English proverb, “If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.” For example, the proverb “Üzüm üzüme baka baka kararır.” (grapes turn black by looking at each other) warns people that friends can acquire each other's negative features (Turkish Language Association, n.d.). In Türkiye, self-adulteration in friendships can be interpreted as a red flag, blocking individuals' growth.

The present results show that friendship quality had indirect effects on well-being through increases or decreases in people's negative attributes. Yet, the indirect effect of perceived self-changes in positive attributes was not confirmed. People are strongly motivated to maintain a positive view of themselves (Tice & Masicampo, 2008). This motivation drives individuals to avoid a negative impression of themselves (i.e., self-protection) and attain a positive impression of themselves (i.e., self-enhancement). Based on their cutting-edge claim that bad is stronger than good, Baumeister et al. (2001) anticipated that self-protective motivation would take precedence over self-enhancement. Confirming this prediction, Ogilvie (1987) demonstrated that life satisfaction was more strongly associated with people's closeness to their undesired self (r = −.72) than their closeness to their ideal self (r = .37) and concluded that people's undesired selves might shape their ideal selves (i.e., the person whom they want to be). The current findings demonstrating the importance of self-pruning and self-adulteration in explaining well-being (as opposed to self-expansion and self-contraction) could be linked to a similar mechanism.

It is typically easier for people to embrace positive self-beliefs than to cope with negative self-beliefs (Thomas et al., 2013). This tendency might lead to compartmentalizing the self in that individuals' positive and negative attributes are organized as separate self-aspect categories (Showers, 1992). Compartmentalization shields individuals from threatening self-relevant information by mentally isolating them. Yet, due to this defensive denial, individuals who engage in compartmentalization might lose their chance for self-growth that requires accepting and addressing negative self-beliefs and making efforts to improve (Thomas et al., 2013). According to Gillath et al. (2010), reminding people of a time when their close others were available, understanding, and caring reduced their defensiveness about personal mistakes, allowing them to become more authentic. The primacy of increases and decreases in negative self-aspects in explaining well-being could also imply that high-functioning friendships are beneficial for individuals' well-being because unconditional positive esteem permits them to reduce differences between their actual and false selves (Rogers, 1961).

The effect of pursuing approach and avoidance goals on well-being changes depending on culture (Tamir & Diener, 2008). Approach goals are seen as more desirable in individualistic than collectivistic cultures, and pursuing more approach than avoidance goals was found to be conducive to well-being only in individualistic cultures (Elliot et al., 2001). Türkiye falls on the midpoint of the individualism–collectivism continuum (Imamoğlu & Karakitapoğlu-Aygün, 1999; Kagitcibasi & Ataca, 2005) and is under the simultaneous influence of collectivism and individualism. The dominance of relational self-changes toward avoiding negative attributes as an indirect mechanism of the association between friendship quality and well-being might be unique to Türkiye. In contrast, replication studies in more individualistic cultures might also confirm the indirect roles of relational self-changes in positive attributes (i.e., self-expansion and self-contraction) in linking close relationships to well-being.

Importantly, the current findings emphasize the importance of addressing friendship-based self-changes via the lens of the two-dimensional model of relational self-change rather than just viewing them as larger self-improvement and self-degradation processes. In the current investigations, for example, self-pruning emerged as the only self-improvement variable and self-adulteration as the only self-degradation variable in accounting for well-being outcomes. However, the second self-improvement variable, self-expansion, and the other self-degradation variable, self-contraction, did not show significant relationships with well-being. These findings highlight the two-dimensional model's superiority over simpler models in capturing significant subtleties in friendship functioning and their psychosocial ramifications. Furthermore, based on the means of the four relational self-change types examined in our research, one may conclude that maladaptive self-processes (i.e., self-contraction and self-adulteration) are less common in best friendships than adaptive ones (i.e., self-expansion and self-pruning). Nonetheless, we discovered that self-concept deterioration (particularly self-adulteration) may reduce individuals' well-being. Identifying when these maladaptive self-processes occur, according to Mattingly et al. (2014), is an essential step in minimizing their detrimental impacts. In Study 1B, individuals are more prone to experience self-degradation when unreliable alliance reduces the quality of their friendships. We recommend that people reconsider their (best) friendships in terms of the risk of being abandoned by their friends in order to maintain their psychological health.

5.1 Limitations and future directions
First, our data were correlational and cross-sectional in nature, preventing us from drawing causal conclusions about the interrelationships between the research variables and understanding the long-term dynamics of self-change. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand how friendship-based self-change affects people's well-being. Second, while we focused on well-being as an intrapersonal outcome, future researchers should investigate how relational self-processes may be linked to friendship maintenance and dissolution.

Third, the present studies focused only on same-sex best friendships. As the preference for mixed-sex friendships was associated with perceiving these friendships as closer, more trusting, and more supportive than same-sex friendships (Baumgarte & Nelson, 2009), future studies comparing self-concept changes in the same- vs. mixed-sex friendships and their ensuing well-being implications could be a fruitful endeavor.

Fourth, we did not collect data about participants' romantic relationship status. When individuals are in romantic relationships, the effect of friendships on their happiness levels is less pronounced (Demir, 2010). Another research avenue might be to compare the role of friendship-based self-changes on well-being among individuals with and without a romantic partner. Besides, emerging adulthood before marriage can be considered a time when friendships play a heightened role in people's lives (Alegre & Benson, 2019). In adulthood, singles were found to have stronger friendship ties than married individuals (Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2016). According to Burton-Chellew and Dunbar (2015), a pattern of dyadic withdrawal from friends is common in midlife. Thus, we recommend that future research consider the intersections of both relationship status and age to identify subgroups in which friendships might be more or less important to people's lives and self-change experiences and their downstream effects on people's well-being.

Fifth, we did not know the age of participants' best friends. Given that friends who are similar in age report higher companionship, satisfaction, intimacy, help, and reliable alliance than friends of different age (Holladay & Kerns, 1999), age differences in close friendships should make a difference in friendship-based self-changes and the associated outcomes. Accordingly, we suggest future research to address age differences in friendships as a potential control or moderator variable. Sixth, since ethnicity has been a sensitive issue in Türkiye (Koc et al., 2008), and our studies were not held from the intergroup relations perspective, we did not address the ethnicities of our participants and their best friends. It is known that cross-group interactions are responsible for reducing prejudices through a self-expansion mechanism (Turner et al., 2008) and are thereby a valuable means toward self-growth and social self-efficacy (Dys-Steenbergen et al., 2016). Given that cross-group interactions differ in their impact on majority and minority members (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005), future research could explore the degrees and types of relational self-change in cross-group friendships and the implications for psychosocial functioning and intergroup tolerance among majority and minority members. Last but not least, this study investigated the dynamics of self-change and its implications for friendships in Türkiye. Given that relationship science, like many other areas of psychology, lacks inclusivity due to drawing from WEIRD samples (Lamarche et al., 2023), making cross-cultural comparisons concerning self-changes in friendships and its link to well-being in future research would expand the emerging body of the literature.

5.2 Concluding remarks
As far as our knowledge, the present research is the first empirical step in examining self-change in friendships by drawing on the two-dimensional relational self-change model. It sheds novel insight into the frequently-studied link between friendship quality and well-being by highlighting the indirect roles of relational self-change in non-Western samples from Türkiye. Good friendships are positively associated with well-being because they protect people becoming their worst selves. Accordingly, we advise our readers to actively maintain their (protectively) transformative friendships for sustaining psychosocial health.
