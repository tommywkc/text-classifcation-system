This study investigated moderating effects of classroom friendship network structures (centralization and
density), teacher–student attunement on aggression and popularity, and gender on changes in the social
status of aggression over 1 school year. Longitudinal multilevel analyses with 2 time points (fall and
spring) were conducted on a sample of 856 fourth and fifth graders from 45 classrooms. Aggressive boys
lost social status over time in classrooms where friendship networks were egalitarian (not centralized) and
dense (with many friendship ties) and where the teacher and students were attuned to (shared perceptions
about) who in their classroom was aggressive and popular. There were no effects for girls. Educational
implications and prospects for setting-level theory, measurement, and intervention are discussed.

Aggressive children vary widely in social status. From the first
years of schooling, some aggressive children benefit from high
peer regard while others are marginalized (Farmer et al., 2010;
Rodkin & Roisman, 2010). In elementary school, children who are
particularly motivated to demonstrate to others their social prowess increase in aggressive behavior over a school year (Rodkin,
Ryan, Jamison, & Wilson, 2013). The high social status that some
aggressive children enjoy can be seen as an intractable problem:
why would socially skilled aggressors be motivated to alter behavior that results in instrumental reward and social appeal (Lansford et al., 2009; Rose & Swenson, 2009)?
One fruitful avenue for investigation might be to extend beyond
the analysis of individual children to consider as well potentially
malleable features of educational settings that support or inhibit
the social status of aggression. Just like individuals, classrooms
vary widely in the popularity of aggression among their students.
In Chang’s (2004) study of 82 Chinese middle school classes,
within-classroom correlations of peer-nominated aggression and
acceptance ranged from – 0.44 to 0.47 (see also Rodkin & Gest,
2011). Classrooms in which aggression is associated with high
peer status do not appear to be healthy settings: such classrooms
are conducive to bullying (Dijkstra, Lindenberg, & Veenstra,
2008), show heightened associations of peer victimization to anxiety and rejection (Kärnä, Voeten, Poskiparta, & Salmivalli, 2010),
and have a low likelihood that potential student bystanders will
feel the efficacy to intervene and stop bullying that they witness
(Pöyhönen, Juvonen, & Salmivalli, 2010). In short, the problem of
the popularity of aggression is an issue of both individual children
and classroom settings.
Social Settings of Elementary Classrooms
An emerging consensus in prevention and education science
points to the importance of setting-level change, yet the development of setting-level theory and measurement is still in its infancy
(Gest, Osgood, Feinberg, Bierman, & Moody, 2011; Neal, Neal,
Atkins, Henry, & Frazier, 2011). From the perspective of the
community psychologist, Seidman (2012) has called for investment in an action science of settings, stressing the need for
theoretical, measurement, and intervention research on social regularities such as norms, typical interaction patterns, and social
networks. From the perspective of the special educator, Farmer,
Lines, and Hamm (2011, p. 249) wrote of the need for teachers to
“develop, guide, and direct the classroom as a society” in developing “a collective set of norms and values that define its culture.”
These perspectives are grounded in ecological theories that stress
dynamic interdependencies between children and the proximal
settings in which they develop (e.g., Bronfenbrenner, 1979).

How might we describe the social aspects of classroom settings?
The present study contributes to educational research on settinglevel change by considering the social status of aggression with
respect to what we postulate are two basic features of elementary
classroom settings: (a) the peer social ecology of children’s friendship choices and (b) teacher attunement (Hamm, Farmer, Dadisman, Gravelle, & Murray, 2011) to which students are perceived
by their peers to be popular and aggressive. Our study hypothesis
was that aggressive behavior would become less popular and less
socially preferred over the course of a school year under conditions
indicative of a healthy classroom setting—namely, when peer social
ecologies could be characterized by an egalitarian, dense pattern of
friendship nominations and when teachers are well attuned to which
students are perceived as being popular and aggressive.
Peer Social Ecologies
A peer social ecology perspective stresses that the classroom is
akin to a small society, or social network, in which children
interact with, influence, and socialize one another (Rodkin & Gest,
2011). As Lewin (1943, p. 115) wrote, “all education is group
work.” The peer social ecology is a proximal setting, a microsystem, which Bronfenbrenner (1996, p. xv) described as “the ultimate mechanism through which development occurs.” Interaction
within the peer social ecology can take many forms, including
frequent affiliation, joint participation in activities, and even negative forms such as bullying–victimization and antipathy. The
present research focuses on the basic interpersonal tie of friendship. Friendships are fundamental to children’s social development
(Hartup & Stevens, 1997). Friends can ameliorate negative outcomes that are associated with peer rejection and victimization
(Adams, Santo, & Bukowski, 2011; Hodges, Boivin, Vitaro, &
Bukowski, 1999), and friends can escalate risk in a context of
deviancy (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011).
The importance of friendship to individual social development
is very well established, but less clear is the importance of settinglevel friendship patterns that may characterize classroom peer
social ecologies. What might be the importance of a peer social
ecology in which friendships are concentrated within a small set of
peers, as opposed to one in which friendships are more evenly
spread out? This question refers to the centralization or hierarchical structure of friendship networks in the peer ecology (Carolan,
2014). Or what might be the importance of a peer social ecology
where many children nominate one another as friends, as opposed
to one where friendship nominations are less frequent? In social
network terms, this question refers to the density of friendships in
the peer ecology. In the following sections, we elaborate why
classroom-level friendship centralization and density may be relevant to the social status of aggression.
Friendship centralization. The construct of centralization refers to whether network ties (in the present research, friendship
ties) have a more hierarchical or more egalitarian pattern. As
Carolan (2014, p. 107) wrote, “Networks that are centralized,
regardless of their density, are ones in which only a small and
exclusive set of actors hold positions of power and control. Decentralized networks, conversely, are those in which power and
control are diffuse and spread over a number of actors.” Classic
child development studies have shown that egalitarian peer groups
have more positive social interactions (i.e., cooperation, less peer
rejection), while hierarchical groups show hostility and less cohesion (Schmuck & Schmuck, 2001). Lewin, Lippitt, and White
(1939) showed that autocratic, hierarchically organized groups
were fertile soil for the emergence of victims and scapegoats.
Sherif (1956) demonstrated that boys participating in hierarchical
friendship teams were less cohesive and less successful in intergroup competitions than boys in egalitarian group structures. Olweus (1978) argued that a model where hierarchy reduces aggressive behavior (i.e., because there is a clear leader and structure
where all know their place) is not appropriate for educational
settings and that in many cases hierarchical peer social ecologies
supported bullying perpetration.
Connections between centralized (hierarchical) peer ecologies
and negative outcomes have been suggested in contemporary
social network research as well. Ahn and her colleagues found that
aggressive third and fourth graders tended to achieve higher perceived popularity in more hierarchical (embedded) classrooms
(Ahn, Garandeau, & Rodkin, 2010), and fourth and fifth grade
aggressive children were more popular and better liked by peers in
classrooms with higher levels of peer status hierarchy (Garandeau,
Ahn, & Rodkin, 2011). Huitsing, Veenstra, Sainio, and Salmivalli
(2012) derived centralization indices from nominations of bullies
and victims across 376 third- to fifth-grade classrooms in Finland,
using the Snijders (1981) centralization metric (which is also
employed in the current study). They reported that after controlling
for bullying and victimization prevalence, children were more
depressed and had lower self-esteem in classrooms where victimization was highly centralized upon a few children (see also
Serdiouk, Rodkin, Madill, Logis, & Gest, in press). Perhaps more
striking, in an archival study of third- to seventh-grade classrooms
from 1950s Scotland, Almquist (2011) reported that children in
highly centralized classes, with centralization derived from “liked
most” nominations, were more likely to report psychiatric and
health problems as adults.
We expected that the social status of aggression would increase
over the school year when children’s friendship patterns were
highly centralized. The reasons are both general, in that highly
centralized peer ecologies may be broadly associated with indices
of poor adjustment, and specific to the social status of aggression,
because hierarchy promotes dominance-related behavior and invites harassment of those on the bottom with no or few friends.
Emerson (1962), for example, noted that in-group status hierarchies were intrinsically involved in power and dependency relations. On the other hand, it is also possible that egalitarian peer
social ecologies promote a tolerant atmosphere in which there is a
wide latitude of acceptable social behavior and in which everyone—including aggressive children— gains in acceptance and status. In this scenario, the social status of aggressors could rise over
the year, or at least stay flat, in peer social ecologies with low
friendship centralization.
Friendship density. Density is a foundational concept in the
social network literature and has particular relevance to the construct of social capital (Carolan, 2014). Density can be measured in
a variety of ways and have a number of interpretations. For
instance, density can be considered as an individual-level measure
(e.g., Child A’s friends are friends with one another but Child B’s
friends are not), but in the present research, friendship density is
considered as a classroom-level variable of the peer social ecology.
Specifically, children tend to nominate many peers as friends in

classrooms with high friendship density but do not nominate many
peers as friends in classrooms with low friendship density. Thus, in
this research, the conceptualization of friendship density and its
relation to social capital focuses on network closure, or the cohesive strength that accrues when friends are friends of one another.
Other conceptions of social capital focus on brokerage, or the
ability of some individuals to bridge networks as liaisons and
develop unique social ties that enable access to a novel array of
resources (Burt, 2001).
The present focus on classroom-level density as an index of
network closure is similar to Putnam’s (2007) notion of bonding
social capital and Coleman’s (1990) emphasis on densely interconnected, closed networks that promote collective well-being.
Classrooms where children nominate many classmates as their
friends may have more positive sentiments, or bonding social
capital, than settings in which friendships are less readily acknowledged. It has long been thought in educational research that classrooms with rich positive ties among children lead to better outcomes (Bronfrenbrenner, 1979; Gronlund, 1959; Roseth, Johnson,
& Johnson, 2008). It might be difficult for aggressors to gain status
through peer harassment in classrooms where many students are
connected by friendship and where even the possible targets of
aggression have friends. Thus, the expectation in this study was
that high friendship density levels would be reflective of social
cohesion and trust, conditions that restrain the emergence of norms
that reinforce the social status of aggression.
Teacher–Student Attunement
Teachers are not themselves part of the peer social ecology (as
teachers are not “peers”), but teachers play a unique leadership role
in the classroom microsystem. Effective classrooms are ones
where teachers build positive relationships with their students,
showing emotional support and a seemingly invisible hand that
guides classroom dynamics toward learning and away from disruption (Bierman, 2011; Farmer et al., 2011). From a peer ecology
perspective, potential teacher influences on student socioemotional
outcomes include factors such as (a) observed responsive teaching
and emotional support for students (e.g., Gest & Rodkin, 2011);
(b) self-reported teacher beliefs, practices, and attitudes; and (c)
teacher knowledge of, or attunement to, the social characteristics
of their students as their students perceive them. The present
research focused on this latter characteristic of teacher attunement.
Given the present study’s focus on aggression and social status,
student aggression and popularity were the characteristics upon
which teacher–student attunement was assessed.
The present emphasis on status- and aggression-based attunement is relatively novel. Most attunement work has been with
reference to peer group placement. Teachers vary widely in their
accurate identification of classroom peer groups (Gest, 2006;
Pearl, Leung, Van Acker, Farmer, & Rodkin, 2007). Neal, Cappella, Wagner, and Atkins (2011) examined teacher–student agreement in perceptions of classroom peer networks, measured through
cognitive social structure techniques and scaled using Jaccard’s
similarity coefficients, in a cross-sectional urban sample of 33
second- through fourth-grade teachers and 669 students. Multiple
regression analyses using classrooms as the unit of analysis suggested greater teacher–student attunement in classrooms with antiaggression norms. Hamm et al. (2011), working with a rural
sample of 26 sixth-grade teachers and their 242 students, compared
teacher and youth reports of group membership derived through
social cognitive mapping procedures. Regression analyses suggested that from fall to spring, students tended to report more
positive views of their school environment, such as a greater sense
of school belonging and a greater willingness to defend victims of
bullying, when they and their teachers agreed on the members of
their peer group. In both Neal et al. (2011) and Hamm et al. (2011),
higher levels of attunement on peer group membership were associated with better classroom adjustment.
Why should attunement to student popularity and aggression be
associated with the social status of aggressive children? The study
hypothesis is that teachers who are more aware of the status and
aggression levels of their students operate from a more knowledgeable position from which to prevent the acquisition of high
social status by aggressive students. Admittedly, there is little
research on teacher–student attunement with respect to popularity
or aggression. Correlations between teacher ratings and peer nominations have ranged widely, from – 0.21 to 0.90 for aggression
(Hudley, 1993) and from 0.27 to 0.84 for peer acceptance (Gronlund, 1950). Gage, Leavitt, and Stone (1955) suggested that
teacher–student attunement levels across domains (i.e., sociometric status and intelligence) are largely unrelated. Status attunement
in particular may be associated with positive teacher characteristics. Gronlund (1955) suggested that more effective teachers know
how socially preferred their students are with one another, and
Chang et al. (2004) reported that teachers with a functional,
authoritative teaching style were most likely to share their students’ nominations of social preference. Therefore, it seemed
reasonable to examine whether teacher–student attunement on
aggression and popularity might be independently associated with
a healthier classroom climate, one in which aggressive children do
not gain social status over the course of the school year.
Analytic Strategy
The overall hypothesis of this study was that aggressive children
would lose social status over the school year in elementary classrooms where children have a more egalitarian (i.e., not centralized)
distribution of friendship nominations received and more dense
friendship ties, and where teachers are well attuned to their students’ sense of who in their classroom is aggressive and popular.
Student gender and ethnicity were conceptualized as covariates in
this research, as were other measures such as the overall prevalence of aggression in the classroom, the number of participants in
the classroom, and prior levels of social status. Interactions involving gender and ethnicity were considered in multilevel models and
pursued when they improved model fit.
Method
Participants
Time 1 participants were 778 fourth and fifth graders (376 boys,
402 girls) and their teachers from 45 classrooms in nine elementary schools in the midwestern United States. These participants
provided data on 951 classmates (480 boys, 471 girls). The ethnic
composition of the participants was 50% African American, 35%
European American, 6% Asian, 5% Hispanic, and 4% classified as

“other.” Participation rates at Time 1 ranged from 63% to 96%
(M1  82%, SD1  9%). At Time 2, student and teacher data were
collected from the same 45 classrooms with 785 participants (383
boys, 402 girls). Time 2 participants provided data on 939 classmates (479 boys, 460 girls). The ethnicity of the participants
consisted of 49% African American, 35% European American, 5%
Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 4% “other.” The actual percentage of
ethnic minority students in each school ranged from 34.1% to
86.8% (M  63.1%). The percentage of students in each school
who received free or reduced-price lunch ranged from 36.0% to
83.3% (M  59.0%). The neighborhoods (census tracts) in which
the schools were located varied considerably in socioeconomic
status as measured by per capita income and the percentage of
individuals below poverty level (U. S. Census Bureau, 2013).
Neighborhood per capita income ranged from $11,100 to $36,700,
with a median of $15,000. The percentage of individuals in each
neighborhood living below poverty level ranged from 5.6% to
39.5%, with a median of 21.6%.
Participation rates at Time 2 ranged from 62% to 100% (M2
83%, SD2  9%). Overall, 890 students participated at either Time
1 or Time 2 (overall participation rate  90%). Active parental
consents and student assents were obtained from all participants at
both Times 1 and 2.
Multiple Imputations for Missing Data
The rates of missing data were 3.1% and 3.8% for Time 1 and
Time 2, respectively, on the peer nomination measures. To maximally utilize the collected information, we applied multiple imputations. Time 1 and Time 2 student-level missing data were
imputed together 10 times by using SAS PROX MI. As a result, 10
sets of imputed data were obtained for 890 participants. The
imputed scores of the dependent variable (Time 2 social status)
were deleted for analysis (see von Hippel, 2007). As a result, data
on 856 students (429 boys, 415 African Americans) from 45
classrooms were analyzed.
Student-Level Variables
During each wave of data collection, children were asked to
nominate peers in their classroom who best fit descriptors related
to student social behaviors. Seven items were used in the present
investigation. Participants were instructed to check off boxes adjacent to the first names and last initials of their classmates; boys
and girls were presented in separate columns. They were told that
they could nominate an unlimited number of same- and other-sex
peers. All self-nominations were excluded from the analysis.
Social status. Children were asked to nominate who is popular (“These are the most popular kids in my class”), who is not
popular (“These are the kids in my class who are not popular”),
peers they like most (“These are the kids who I would like most to
play with”), and like least (“These are the kids who I would like
least to play with”) in their classroom. For each item, we computed
proportion scores by dividing the number of nominations received
by the number of participants in each classroom. For each time
point, we computed perceived popularity scores by subtracting not
popular from popular proportions and obtained social preference
scores by subtracting liked least from liked most proportions.
Resulting difference scores for Time 2 perceived popularity, social
preference, and global status (average of popularity and preference) were used as dependent variables. Time 1 difference scores
were centered around the class mean and used as a control variable
(Enders & Tofighi, 2007).
Aggression. Aggression was measured with three peer nomination items that assessed relational and overt aggression subtypes
(  .94 at Time 1): make fun of (“These kids make fun of people.
They like to make fun of other kids and embarrass them in front of
other people”), say mean things (“These kids say mean things to
other kids, and they spread nasty rumors about other kids”), and
start fights (“These kids start fights. These kids push other kids
around, hit them, or kick them”). A composite score for Time 1
was obtained by averaging proportion scores for the three items,
and the composite score was mean-centered within each classroom.
Gender and ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity information was
collected based on children’s self-reports. In the cases where
self-reports were not available, we used information based on
teacher reports and school records. Gender was dummy coded as
female  0 and male  1. As African Americans were a majority
group (50%) in the current sample, ethnicity was coded as nonAfrican American  0 and African American  1. Both gender
and ethnicity variables were centered within classroom.
Classroom-Level Variables
Two within-classroom structure measures (friendship centralization and friendship density) and two teacher–student attunement
measures (on aggression and popularity) were the classroom-level
variables of greatest interest. Mean classroom aggression level, the
proportion of African American students in the classroom, and the
number of participants in each classroom were used as covariates.
All classroom-level variables were derived from 45 classrooms of
Time 1 data and centered at the grand mean for analyses.
Friendship centralization. The index of centralization was
obtained from within-classroom friendship nominations at Time 1.
Children were asked to circle “yes” or “no” to the question: “Some
kids have a number of close friends, but others have just one best
friend, and still others don’t have a best friend. What about you?
Do you have a best friend?” Children responding affirmatively
were prompted to write the names of the children whom they
considered to be their best friends and to circle “yes” or “no” to
indicate if the friend they named was in their class or not. Six lines
were provided for best-friend identification, but children were told
that they could list fewer or more than six friends. Only withinclassroom best-friend nominations were used for analyses. Sixteen
(1.9%) among 856 students reported more than six withinclassroom friends. The mean of giving best-friend nominations
was 2.95 (SD  1.93; R  0 –10). The variance of received
best-friend nominations was computed for each classroom to quantify the centralization of within-classroom best-friend nominations
representing the dispersion or heterogeneity of the received (indegree) friendship nominations among students (Snijders, 1981).
A small variance indicates that the number of received nominations in the distribution tends to be clustered around the mean,
which reflects a relatively egalitarian distribution of best-friend
nominations among students. A large variance indicates that the
received friendship nominations are widely dispersed around the
mean and vary greatly from one student to another (see also

Almquist, 2011). Centralization indices differed widely across
classrooms, ranging from 0.884 to 9.862 (M  3.32, SD  1.75).
Friendship density. The index of density was obtained based
on within-classroom best-friend nominations sent (out-degree) at
Time 1. Density for best-friend nominations was computed as the
number of best-friend nominations present divided by the number
of possible nominations in a unit of network (classroom in the
current study) and ranged from 0 to 1. In the current study,
best-friend nominations were not necessarily reciprocal (A nominated B, but B did not nominate A as a friend), and thus “n(n 
1)”—instead of “n(n  1)/2”—was used for the number of possible nominations. The friendship density of each classroom was
computed, ranging across classrooms from 0.074 to 0.318 (M
0.133, SD  0.046).
Teacher–student attunement on aggression. The index of
teacher–student attunement on aggression was obtained by correlating teacher- and peer-reported aggression scores within each
classroom. The Interpersonal Competence Scale–Teacher (ICS–T)
proposed by Cairns, Leung, Gest, and Cairns (1995) was used to
measure teachers’ perceptions of individual students who participated in this study. The ICS–T consists of 21 items with a 7-point
Likert scale. In each classroom, teacher-reported aggression scores
obtained by combining three Time 1 ICS–T items (argues, trouble,
and fights;   .893) were correlated with the composite score of
aggression assigned by peer nominations (makes fun of, says mean
things, and starts fights). Teacher–student aggression correlations
ranged from 0.10 to 0.94 (M  0.753, SD  0.152).
Teacher–student attunement on popularity. Like teacher–
student attunement on aggression, we computed the correlation
between teacher- and peer-reported popularity in each classroom
to obtain an index of teacher–student popularity attunement. As
Cairns et al. (1995) did, we used ICS–T items (popular with boys,
popular with girls, and lots of friends;   .859) to obtain
students’ popularity scores measured by teachers. These three
Time 1 ICS-T items were composited by averaging. Then, teacherreported popularity was correlated with peer-reported popularity
for each classroom. To make a more accurate comparison, we
computed peer-reported popularity from the items with the information most similar to teacher-reported popularity— one peer
nomination item, popular (“These are the most popular kids in my
class”) and children’s received nominations of friendship reports
(  .657). Teacher–student popularity correlations ranged from
0.11 to 0.87 across 45 classrooms (M  0.592, SD  0.179).
Classroom prevalence of aggression. The proportion scores
used for the assessment of individual aggression were averaged for
each classroom to obtain a measure of the overall prevalence of
aggression in the classroom. Proportions ranged from .084 to .429
(M  .218, SD  .063). This measure essentially indexes the
average proportion of children circled for items of the aggressionrelated peer nominations within each classroom.
Proportion of African American students. We investigated
classroom ethnic composition via the classroom proportion of
African American students, the majority group in this sample.
Percentages of African American students varied from 0% to 91%
across classrooms. (M  49.5%, SD  21.3).
Number of classroom participants. Friendship density and
centralization are sensitive to the number of participants in each
classroom (r  –.51, p  .01; r  .33, p  .05, respectively).
Thus, the number of participants was added to the models as a
classroom-level covariate. The number of participants in each
classroom varied from 10 to 23 (M  17.3, SD  3.31) and
covaried strongly with class size (r  .82, p  .001).
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Participants versus nonparticipants. Mean difference tests
were performed to figure out if the participants significantly differed from the nonparticipants. Multiple independent t tests were
performed for student-level variables. At Time 1, the participants
were significantly perceived as more popular (t  –2.33; p  .05)
and more preferred (t  –3.39; p  .001) by peers, but less
aggressive (t  3.75; p  .001) than the nonparticipants. However,
at Time 2, the participants were not different from the nonparticipants in terms of their perceived popularity (t  – 0.28; p  .10)
or social preference (t  – 0.99; p  .10).
Bivariate correlations. Correlations among student-level
variables at Time 1 (fall) and Time 2 (spring) are presented in
Table 1. Perceived popularity and social preference were positively correlated (rs  .65). Time 1 perceived popularity and social
preference were strongly correlated with the corresponding Time 2
variables (rs  .81, and .71, respectively). Time 1 aggression was
positively associated with Time 2 perceived popularity (r  .18),
which did not differ by gender (r  .24 for boys; r  .14 for girls;

for non-African Americans; Fisher’s Z  0.63, p  .05).
Classroom-level correlations are presented in Table 2. Friendship centralization was positively correlated with number of participants (r  .33, p  .05). In classrooms with dense friendship
relations, it was more difficult for teachers to be attuned to peers’
perceptions of who is aggressive (r  –.33, p  .05) and popular
(r  –.35, p  .05). Friendship density was negatively correlated
with the number of participants in the class (r  –.51, p  .01).
Teacher–student attunement on aggression and popularity were not
correlated (r  .08). Classroom mean aggression was positively
correlated with proportion of African Americans (r  .30, p  .05)
but negatively correlated with number of classroom participants
(r  –.32, p  .05).
Aggregating popularity and preference. Table 1 suggests
that perceived popularity and social preference are strongly correlated, yet with differential relationships to aggression. In preliminary analyses, perceived popularity and social preference were
considered separately as dependent variables in multilevel modeling, with the hypothesis that classroom-level moderators of
aggression–social status relationships might be stronger for perceived popularity (positively correlated with aggression) than for
social preference (negatively correlated with aggression). However, analyses yielded the same results regardless of whether
perceived popularity or social preference served as the dependent
variable, and unique (partialed) versions of these variables did not
have significant predictors. Thus, in the analyses to follow, perceived popularity and social preference were composited to form
an overall construct of social status. Within-classroom correlations
between Time 1 aggression and Time 2 social status ranged widely
around zero, from r  –.6 in one classroom to r  0.7 in another
(M  –.02, SD  .32).
Multilevel Modeling
Multilevel analyses using hierarchical linear and nonlinear modeling (HLM Version 6) was performed to evaluate whether there
were classroom-level moderators of status–aggression associations
(Raudenbush, Bryk, & Congdon, 2004). HLM 6 analyzed 10
imputed data sets consecutively and provided an averaged output.
In the HLM models, spring (Time 2) social status was the outcome
variable, and peer-nominated aggression was the primary independent variable. Fall (Time 1) social status was included to control
for stability in social status, and fall aggression, gender, ethnicity,
and interactions between these demographic variables and fall
aggression were included as student-level (Level-1) predictors.
Classroom-level (Level-2) predictors included the centralization
and density of children’s friendship networks and measures of
teacher–student attunement on aggression and popularity, with the
additional inclusion of the following covariates: classroom prevalence of aggression, proportion of African American students in
the classroom, and number of classroom participants. Preliminary
analyses showed that none of the classroom-level predictors significantly moderated ethnicity-social status and Aggression 
Ethnicity–Social Status associations. The averaged result of
likelihood-ratio tests (deviance tests) indicated that removing
cross-level interactions involving ethnicity did not affect model fit,
	2
(14)  13.547, p  .10), and so cross-level interactions involving ethnicity were trimmed. Cross-level interactions involving
gender significantly improved model fit (	2
(14)  26.783, p 
.05), and so cross-level interactions involving gender were retained.

ing Level-2 predictors, Step 3: including Level-1 predictors). For
the outcome variable, social status at Time 2, ICC was computed
by using the variance components of the unconditional model. Of
the variance in Time 2 social status, 7.4% was between classrooms
(
00  0.009, 
2  0.108). For the model in Step 2, 78.3% of the
explained between-classroom variance in Time 2 social status was
accounted for by classroom-level predictors of centralization, density, teacher–student attunement on aggression and popularity,
classroom-aggression level, proportion of African Americans, and
number of participants (
00  0.002). For Model 1, including
student-level predictors (aggression, gender, ethnicity, Aggression  Gender, and Aggression  Ethnicity) reduced the withinclassroom variance in Time 2 social status by 80.4% (
2  0.021).
Deviance tests were performed for nonsignificant random slopes
(i.e., aggression, ethnicity, Aggression  Gender, Aggression 
Ethnicity) to determine if the slopes should have random or fixed
coefficients (see Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992). The averaged deviance tests suggested that slopes for aggression and Aggression 
Gender should be random, 	2
(7)  18.385, p  .05, and 	2
(7)
15.130, p  .05, respectively. However, slopes for ethnicity and
Aggression  Ethnicity should be fixed, 	2
(7)  7.801, p  .05,
and 	2
(7)  10.677, p  .05, respectively. Therefore, Model 2
included random slopes for only aggression, gender, and Aggression  Gender in the current analysis. In Model 2, student-level
predictors reduced the within-classroom variance in Time 2 social
status by 78.7% (
2  0.023).
Modeling results. Table 4 presents results for the hierarchical
linear model involving social status and aggressive behavior. Table
4 shows that African American students (  0.063, t  3.21, p 
.01) and boys who were aggressive at Time 1 (  0.183, t  2.15,
p  .05) increased their social status by Time 2. Classrooms with
more dense friendship relations at Time 1 had greater overall
social status at Time 2 (  1.801, t  4.09, p  .001). Teacher–
student attunement on aggression was also related to increased
social status (  0.248, t  2.69, p  .05).
There were multiple classroom-level moderators of aggression–
social status associations. Aggressors lost social status in lesscentralized classrooms (  0.215, t  2.48, p  .05), particularly
among boys (  0.122, t  2.20, p  .05). As shown in Figure
1, highly aggressive boys lost social status over time in classrooms
with low friendship centralization but gained social status in classrooms with high centralization. As shown in Figure 2, aggressors
lost social status in classrooms with high friendship density (
–16.851, t  –3.95, p  .001), again only for boys (  – 8.392,
t  –3.14, p  .01).
When teachers and students agreed on relative student aggression levels, more aggressive students lost social status over the
school year (  –2.691, t  –2.50, p  .05); this moderating
effect was apparent only for boys (  –1.711, t  –2.45, p 
.05). As Figure 3 illustrates, aggressive boys came to have lower
social status when their teacher was attuned to the students considered to be aggressive by their peers. Likewise, Figure 4 shows
that aggressive boys lost social status in classrooms where teachers
and students agreed on who was popular (  – 0.964, t  –2.19,
p  .05). The number of classroom participants moderated
aggression–status associations (  – 0.130, t  –2.59, p  .05),
again for boys only (  – 0.079, t  –2.55, p  .05). In
classrooms with more study participants, aggressive students
tended to lose status over the year. Finally, classroom aggression
level and its associated interactions were not associated with social
status.
Discussion
The fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms that participated in this
study varied widely in how peer social status and aggressive
behavior were associated. In some classrooms, children nominated

by their peers as aggressive—starting fights, making fun of and
saying mean things to others—tended also to be nominated as
popular and likeable. In other classrooms, correlations between
aggression and social status were zero or negative. The study
hypothesis was that healthy classroom social dynamics, where
aggression and status are not positively associated, would be
promoted by dense peer friendship networks that are inclusively
distributed, with shared perceptions between teacher and students.
Results were supportive of this prediction, suggesting two sets of
setting-level moderators of status–aggression associations: (a) the
centralization and density of children’s friendship patterns and (b)
the degree to which teachers and students share perceptions of who
in the classroom is aggressive and popular. In analyses that were
significant for boys but not for girls, aggressors lost social status
over the school year in classrooms where children received relatively equal numbers of friendship nominations from their peers,
where children nominated more peers as friends, and where teachers and students were well attuned to one another’s perceptions of
the classroom social reality.

CLASSROOM-LEVEL PREDICTORS 1151
Friendship Centralization and Density
A contribution of the present study is to extend a long-standing
developmental focus on friendships to the setting level, utilizing
social network measures of friendship centralization and density
that characterize not just one child or dyad, but the classroom as a
whole (Gest et al., 2011; Seidman, 2011). Centralization findings
suggest benefits that accrue from a more cohesive, integrated
classroom peer ecology. Hierarchy has its functions (Ronay,
Greenaway, Anicich, & Galinsky, 2012), but it has long been
thought that egalitarian or democratic peer ecologies are superior
to those in which social capital is held by just a few (e.g.,
Schmuck, 1966; Sherif, 1956). For this reason, cooperative learning techniques often attempt to promote egalitarian, democratic
peer relationships (Roseth et al., 2008). Conversely, the Olweus
(1978) definition of bullying requires substantial physical or psychological (e.g., social status) power inequality between bullies
and the children whom they harass. Bullies thrive on hierarchy, as
hierarchy can legitimate aggression directed at low-status targets
who have few avenues for obtaining social support and capital
(Emerson, 1962). Thus, highly centralized peer ecologies have
been associated with negative outcomes such as (a) more depression for victims of harassment (Huitsing et al., 2010); (b) increased
peer rejection (Mikami, Lerner, & Lun, 2010; Serdiouk et al., in
press); (c) higher levels of relational aggression among socially
central second through fourth graders (Neal & Cappella, 2012); (d)
less behavioral engagement, less prosocial behavior, and higher
levels of teacher-reported depression among kindergarteners
(Boyce et al., 2012); (e) worse health outcomes for adults who as
children were enrolled in classrooms with highly centralized status
networks (Almquist, 2011); and (f) greater popularity for aggressive children (Ahn et al., 2010; Garandeau et al., 2011). To this list
of the negative correlates of social stratification, this study suggests that hierarchically structured peer ecologies may also promote the social status of aggression in elementary school.
A word is in order concerning our description of egalitarian
classrooms, and particularly of the declining social status of aggressors in such classrooms, as healthy. At the classroom level, our
premise is that more positive (or “healthy”) classroom climates are
ones in which aggression does not promote social status, or vice
versa. Yet what is best for the collective is not necessarily best for
every individual in the collective. It may not be positive for a
particular aggressive child to lose social status, and it is not healthy
for any child, aggressive or not, to suffer high levels of peer
rejection (Mikami et al., 2010). In no way does this study suggest
that rejection is positive for aggressive children; instead, this study
does suggest that classrooms where aggression and status are not
positively associated are better for most students in that classroom.
With respect to density, fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms in
which many students were nominated as friends also had many
students nominated as popular and liked, and in these classrooms,
aggressive boys were most likely to lose social status from fall to
spring. These findings, while they hold intuitive appeal, could have
gone the other way. Hartup and Stevens (1997) noted that simply
having a friend means little without also knowing the quality of the
friendship and the characteristics of one’s friends. Friends can
promote depression and co-rumination in one another (Rose,
2002). Friends engage in more conflict than nonfriends, and iatrogenic effects may occur when antisocial youth befriend one
another (Dishion & Tipsord, 2011). Classroom-wide measures of
density may not capture distinctive network subgroups, such as
small but tightly connected cliques of aggressive boys for whom
friendship might lead to increases in problem behavior. However,
in this study, friendship was not studied between dyads, nor was it
restricted to friendships among children preselected for problem
behavior. Rather, in the present sample, friendship density may
refer more to the positive sentiments expressed among a community of children and, thus, to cohesion in the social network
(Almquist, 2011) or to what Putnam (2007) termed bonding social
capital, both of which constitute positive setting conditions that
may discourage aggression.
Teacher Attunement to Classroom Peer Ecologies
There has been a real lack of attention to teachers in research on
children’s peer relationships (Chang et al., 2004). The subject of
“teachers” appears on only three of the 600-plus pages of Rubin,
Bukowski, and Laursen’s (2009) Handbook of Peer Interactions
(all in Wentzel, 2009, pp. 540 –542). Yet classic and recent works
suggest the importance of synchrony between teachers and peer
social ecologies and the possibility of revealing the invisible hand
of successful teachers who guide classroom peer ecologies towards
achievement and harmony (Bierman, 2011; Farmer et al., 2011;
Kindermann, 2011). Students take cues from their teacher about
how to interact with their peers (Chang et al., 2004). Schmuck
(1966, p. 63) noted that “teachers with more positive social climates,
compared with others, spoke about . . . psychological principles more.
They had more detailed ideas about personality dynamics.” In the
current study, results indicated that (a) teacher–student attunement
on aggression and popularity were uncorrelated (see also Gage et
al., 1955) and (b) greater attunement between teachers and students were associated with aggressive boys losing social status
over the academic year. Potentially relevant teacher characteristics
are wide-ranging and include demographics, morale, and teaching
experience, attitudes, beliefs, and practices (Bierman, 2011). Still,
study findings support Gronlund’s (1955, p. 277) early supposition
that teachers’ accurate understanding of their students’ personality
and status may be “a necessary prerequisite” for effective teaching.
At this point, we are limited in conceptualizing teacher-student
attunement as either a specific teaching skill that improves classroom management, or as a proxy for a more global index of teacher
effectiveness. In future work, it will be important to include not
only teachers’ knowledge of their students’ behavioral and social
characteristics but also their knowledge of students’ peer groups
and friendships, antipathies and bully–victim relationships (Ahn,
Rodkin, & Gest, 2013). It will be essential to go beyond measures
of attunement to include observations of teacher emotional support
(e.g., Cappella, Kim, Neal, & Jackson, 2013), teachers’ stated
practices regarding classroom social dynamics, and even seating charts that reflect teachers’ intuitive ideas about how to
organize the learning community in front of them (Gest &
Rodkin, 2011). As researchers include a broader array of information regarding teacher knowledge, beliefs, and practices,
some more effective strategies—such as teachers’ knowing
which students in their classroom are aggressive and popular—
may come to the fore.

1152 AHN AND RODKIN
Moderation by Gender
Why were the significant effects of this study moderated by gender,
so that only for boys were friendship networks and teacher–student
attunement related to changing associations between social status and
aggression? One possibility is that the status–aggression phenomenon
is more salient for boys, due to greater emphasis on dominance in
male peer groups (Maccoby, 1998). On the other hand, correlations
between popularity and aggression were similar among boys and
girls, although social preference and aggression were more negatively
correlated among girls than boys. In addition, the aggression peer
nominations used in this study, items like make fun of others and say
mean things to others, may not fully characterize the range of behaviors usually categorized as relationally aggressive (Neal & Cappella,
2012). Girls who are physically aggressive may be highly disliked
among their peers and thus may not be easily amenable to having their
peer reputations changed by teacher practices and strategies that work
for boys (e.g., Chang et al., 2004). Another possibility is that measures
of the classroom peer ecology could be more relevant for boys than
girls. Maccoby (1998) wrote that that peer group culture among boys
and girls shows an asymmetry, namely, that boys’ groups are generally more cohesive and structured than girls’ groups, with girls more
likely to be positioned in dyadic relationships. Thus, it could be that
the peer ecological features studied in the present report are more
sensitive to variation among boys’ groups, especially when dealing
with aggression and that different or differently measured constructs
are needed to better capture relationships among girls.
As with any higher order interaction, it is also possible that the
present results, however consistent across predictors, are tenuous.
For instance, Henry, Farrell, Schoeny, Tolan, and Dymnicki (2011)
found that school-level norms favoring nonviolence and positive
interpersonal climates, derived from aggregated individual-level
scores, were better predictors of girls’ aggression-related behaviors
and attitudes (see also Gest & Rodkin, 2011; Powers, Bierman, & the
Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2013). In short, gender moderation in the present study has to be cautiously interpreted.
Study results regarding gender moderation might be considered
as speaking more broadly about the role of gender in elementary
classrooms. There are setting-level measures that might better assess
the quality of relationships between boys and girls, such as the
proportion of other-sex antipathies and friendships, the prevalence of
other-sex bullying, and peer group gender integration. Teacher practices that make gender salient (e.g., “Boys line up to the left and girls
to the right. Let’s go to lunch!” see Bigler & Liben, 2006) help shape
children’s attitudes regarding gender and may have an influence on
classroom climate. Teacher understanding of the development of
gender segregation, preventing negative gender dynamics from becoming entrenched, and promoting the social capital that comes from
quality cross-gender relationships are important tasks for an educationally relevant study of children’s peer relationships.
Study Limitations
There are additional limitations to this study. As the results of
variance component analyses show, the role of classroom-level
variables in explaining social status is relatively small (5.8%),
perhaps because between-classroom variance in the measure used
to assess social status is also small (7.4%). At the same time, it is
unclear what constitutes a meaningful educational effect at the
setting level, given that classrooms have many children and may
have compounding effects over time (Powers et al., 2012). Another
limitation might be our unexpected finding concerning number of
participants, largely a function of class size. Possibly some negative effects that are often attributed to large class sizes are largely
a byproduct of more centralization and lower density levels in
friendship networks. In both cases, limitations point to a need to
better flesh out what Seidman (2012) called the ecometrics of
setting-level measurement.
The present analysis was limited in considering classroom friendship networks and teacher–student attunement as predictor variables.
They could also be examined in relation to one another. As Almquist
(2011, p. 10) wrote, “Nobody has a better opportunity to shape
classroom structure and dynamics than the class teacher.” For example, Gest and Rodkin (2011), in a cross-sectional analysis of 39 first-,
third-, and fifth-grade classrooms, suggested that teachers who are
observed to be emotionally supportive have classrooms where
more children have reciprocated friendships and that teachers
who actively attempt to promote new friendships have, for girls,
more egalitarian status hierarchies. Neal et al. (2011) reported
that levels of teacher–student attunement on aggression were
negatively related to the overall prevalence of aggression. An
essential step for building on the present report is to examine
whether classroom teachers and peer ecologies interact or show
transactional effects over the school year (Bierman, 2011).
Conclusions
Aggressors who enjoy high social status may be a leading edge
for negative peer socialization, influencing aggressive and nonaggressive peers alike (Logis, Rodkin, Gest, & Ahn, 2013). Popular–
aggressive youth have little reason to change and may not see
current remedial techniques as right for them (Lansford et al.,
2009; Rose & Swenson, 2009). Thus, this research focused less on
changing aggressive behavior within the individual and more on
highlighting potentially malleable setting-level factors that might
decrease the social status that aggression can bring. We conceptualized setting-level change via social– ecological frameworks,
but it is instructive to note that the need for setting-level change
with respect to aggression has also been voiced from evolutionary
perspectives. Building from the insight that aggression can be
adaptive, Ellis et al. (2012, pp. 605– 606) suggested setting-level
interventions that consider “proactively how to ‘engineer’ social
networks in early adolescence . . . promoting group structures and
behavioral strategies that enable adolescents to earn status for
prosocial behaviors . . . and avoiding dynamics that confer social
status and peer reward for antisocial behavior.”
Educators might not want to wait until adolescence to proactively intervene. Even in elementary school, popular–aggressive
children are an alternative authority structure to teachers and
educators, and possibly to parents as well, challenging traditional
socialization goals. “They,” in this case, is also “we,” because
inherent in having social status is being well integrated into social
networks. By approaching the phenomenon of popular–aggressive
children from the perspective of the setting, this study provides the
first longitudinal demonstration that the nature of classroom
friendship networks and the shared perceptions between teachers
and students on student behavioral characteristics are related to
whether aggressive children lose or gain social status over the
school year. Future work will have to better specify how malleable

friendship networks and teacher–student attunement—along with
other measures of teacher and peer social ecologies—are and how
appropriate teacher training can promote and effect meaningful
educational change. Since the popular–aggressive child is in some
sense a product of the social system, it stands to follow that
setting-level phenomena are an opportune and appropriate means
of countering the age-old appeal, particularly among males, of
aggressive and antisocial behavior.
