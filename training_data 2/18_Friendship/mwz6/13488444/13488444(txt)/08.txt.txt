Workplace friendship obligations of openness and favoritism are likely to conflict with
organizational norms of discretion and neutrality. This dilemma is especially apparent
for Simmelian brokers, who divide time and attention across multiple, otherwise disconnected, friendship cliques. In two samples, we found support for the core idea that
the fit between the requirements of the network role and the personality of the individual
facilitates trust. Simmelian brokers are trusted by their friends if they exhibit a roleappropriate diplomatic personality style involving flexibility of self-presentation (high
self-monitoring) and inhibition of verbal loquaciousness (low blirtatiousness). Of course,
not everyone engages in Simmelian brokerage. Some individuals experience a strongly
cohesive situation—i.e., a single friendship clique within which they are embedded. For
these nonbrokers, we hypothesized and found that the most appropriate trait combination likely to maintain the trust of a group of tightly bound colleagues involved
a forthright, be-true-to-yourself, loquacious personality style (i.e., low self-monitoring,
high blirtatiousness). In introducing a personality–network fit perspective concerning
whether Simmelian brokers are trusted by their colleagues, we help reconcile discrepancies in prior literature concerning whether these brokers are paralyzed into indecision by cross-pressures. Brokers who flexibly and guardedly manage individuality
facilitate interconnection across cliques.

Workplace friendships are common in organizations (Morrison & Cooper-Thomas, 2013) and have
been investigated by organizational behavior researchers from the very beginning of the discipline,
both in terms of dyadic relationships and in terms of
cliques (e.g., Roethlisberger & Dixon, 1939). Workplace friendships facilitate productivity, employee
retention, job satisfaction, job involvement, team
cohesion, and other positive outcomes (Balkundi &
Harrison, 2006; Berman, West, & Richter, 2002; Rath,
2006) including personal growth and emotional
support (Colbert, Bono, & Purvanova, 2016). However, these business friendships (i.e., friendships
between coworkers—Ingram & Zou, 2008) are difficult to manage because the overlap between affective
and instrumental obligations (Lincoln & Miller, 1979)
subjects friendship pairs to stresses and strains
(Ingram & Zou, 2008; Methot, Lepine, Podsakoff, &
Christian, 2016) that can undermine trust (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996). Friendship is a role that comes with
clear obligations (Henderson & Argyle, 1986) to provide assistance, to be fully open and honest, to share
confidences, to keep disclosures from others, and to
provide special treatment and favoritism (Bridge &
Baxter, 1992). Many of these obligations conflict with
governing principles of workplace interaction emphasizing efficiency and rationality (Ingram & Zou,
2008).
The undermining effects on trust of business
friendships may be particularly evident when an individual has two sets of friends who are not friends
with each other—a relatively common phenomenon
in organizations (Burt, 2016). The individual who is
caught between obligations and time demands to two
internally cohesive groups may find that friends in
each group expect priority when it comes to the

transmission of valuable gossip and advice (Casciaro&
Lobo, 2008). The person caught between two or more
cliques has been labeled a Simmelian broker1
(Krackhardt, 1999) and a multiple insider (Vedres &
Stark, 2010). The situation has been analyzed from
a balance-theory perspective, according to which an
individual who has friendship bonds to two nonoverlapping groups finds it difficult to adopt a stable
attitude toward those ideas or people about which the
groups differ (Davis, 1963: 450–51). A recent case
study illustrated the paralyzing effect of such crosspressures on a Simmelian broker who was “frozen by
the set of constraints imposed by the numerous cliques” of friends to which he belonged (Krackhardt,
1999: 206). There has also been research on brokerage
between cohesive groups more generally (not exclusively concerned with friendship relations) in terms of
how the brokers have to overcome the appearance of
ambiguous loyalties to two different groups and
manage the possible disruption of trust if they are to
facilitate knowledge transfer, innovation (de Vaan,
Stark, & Vedres, 2015; Vedres & Stark, 2010), and their
own productivity (Burt, 2015). As a recent review of
brokerage noted, “highly cohesive groups may develop a belief that the broker is not ‘one of us,’ which
could in turn trigger skepticism of the broker’s motives” (Stovel & Shaw, 2012: 144). Left unexamined in
this literature is the possibility that the personality of
individuals helps explain why they differ in how well
they manage the potential for disruption of trust that is
one possible consequence of the Simmelian broker’s
multiple insider role (e.g., Vedres & Stark, 2010: 1159).
The dilemma, therefore, is that brokers between
friendship cliques must be trusted by others in order
to succeed in the vital organizational role of bringing
new and incompletely understood combinations of
previously disconnected ideas across boundaries
(Vedres & Stark, 2010). However, trust itself tends
to be engendered within closed, rather than open,
network structures (Burt, 2001; Coleman, 1988;
Granovetter, 1985), and to be amplified by the presence of mutual friends and other third parties (Burt &
Knez, 1995). In particular, one of the challenges
facing Simmelian brokers is to sometimes hide and
sometimes share knowledge across friendship clique
boundaries. Being seen to hide knowledge that is
useful to the members of a particular clique is likely
to engender distrust (e.g., Cerne, Nerstad, Dysvik, ?
& Skerlavaj, 2014). However, to give away the secrets ?
of one clique to another is to betray one’s membership
of the clique, as discussed in Dalton’s (1959) classic
analysis of how cliques are formed around secrecy
(Costas & Grey, 2014).
Some people, we suggest, are better than other
people at managing the challenge of conversations
and interactions across disconnected friendship cliques. The research question is: Does personality affect
whether Simmelian brokers are trusted by their
friends? To answer this question, we build on pioneering (e.g., Burt, Jannotta, & Mahoney, 1998) and
recent (e.g., Burt, 2012; Kleinbaum, Jordan, & Audia,
2015) work on the personalities of those who occupy
structurally important positions in friendship networks (Fang, Landis, Zhang, Anderson, Shaw, &
Kilduff, 2015). The research focus is on how the
combination of self-monitoring (i.e., flexibility of selfpresentation to different groups [Snyder, 1974]) and
blirtatiousness (i.e., disinhibition of verbal expressiveness [Swann & Rentfrow, 2001]) relates to trust for
those in Simmelian brokerage roles.
Thus, we ask how people with different combinations of self-monitoring and blirtatiousness deal
with potential mistrust inherent in the Simmelian
brokerage role. Over a century ago, James wrote that
the individual has “as many different social selves as
there are distinct groups of persons about whose
opinion he cares” (James, 1890: 294). In the current
research, these distinct groups of people are the
friendship cliques who claim the time and attention
of their members, including brokers whose loyalties

1 Following Krackhardt (1999: 188), we define a Simmelian broker as one who connects at least two cliques
such that no member of one clique except the broker is
directly connected to any member of the other clique; and
where within each clique all members are strongly and
reciprocally tied to each other.
2018 Tasselli and Kilduff 803
are divided between two or more such cliques. We
predict that trust will be greatest when the personality
of the individual and the structural characteristics
of the individual’s network fit in ways that play to
the expression of behaviors that meet the demands of
the specific social situation while downplaying situationally inappropriate behaviors (Tett, Simonet,
Walser, & Brown, 2013).
Our paper makes three main contributions to theory and research. Prior work has dealt with brokerage
between cliques as a structural dilemma. Supplementing this emphasis, the current paper contributes
to the micro-foundations approach to organizational
social networks (Tasselli, Kilduff, & Menges, 2015)
via a consideration of how a combination of personality traits affects whether individuals are trusted by
colleagues. Second, by introducing a personality–
network fit perspective, we help resolve the debate
among structuralists concerning whether the constraints of Simmelian brokerage suppress or liberate
the broker’s individuality. Third, in examining the
extent to which Simmelian brokers are trusted, we
necessarily examine the contrasting situation of
nonbrokers whose friendship ties are captured within
single cliques. Thus, we go beyond prior research that
has focused only on the personalities of brokers
(e.g., Burt, Kilduff, & Tasselli, 2013; Sasovova, Mehra,
Borgatti, & Schippers, 2010) in considering how
a range of personality orientations is likely to find
effective expression across social network roles in
organizations.
TRUST IN SIMMELIAN BROKERAGE
We focus on trust between friends as the dependent
variable. Trust has been described as the most fundamental judgment that can be made about another
person (Ferrin, Dirks, & Shah, 2006: 871). Trust is
critical to the brokerage role in organizations given the
requirement to coordinate across clusters of people
who themselves are not connected (see the extensive
discussion of trust in relation to brokerage and closure
in Burt [2005]). In order to transfer knowledge across
even strong ties, it is necessary to be trusted (Levin &
Cross, 2004). Trust is a central characteristic of relationships in that it promotes effective knowledge
creation and sharing in networks (Abrams, Cross,
Lesser, & Levin, 2003) and relates to many other aspects of individual, group, and organizational functioning, including work performance (at individual
and group levels), organizational commitment, and
intention to leave (Dirks & Ferrin, 2001). The gossip
of co-clique members can impose strains on the
Simmelian broker’s maintenance of cross-clique trust
relationships (Burt & Knez, 1995: 275).
Friendship networks in organizations are “systems for
making decisions, mobilizing resources, concealing or
transmitting information, and performing other functions closely allied with work behavior and interaction”
(Lincoln & Miller, 1979: 196). We define friendship as
a reciprocated liking relationship between two people
who frequently interact (e.g., Krackhardt, 1999). In organizational contexts, however, relationships are often
multifaceted (Lewicki,McAllister, & Bies, 1998: 439) and
feelings of positivity and negativity toward friends are
common, as the literature on “frenemies” (e.g., Redman,
2013) and ambivalent friendships (i.e., those that are simultaneously both positive and negative) (e.g., HoltLunstad, Uchino, Smith, & Hicks, 2007) has described.
From this we infer that two people may express mutual
liking even though, in certain aspects of their interactions, one may have low trust in the other.
Trust in a Simmelian broker is likely to come under
strain given that the members of each clique to which
the broker belongs have no friends (other than the
broker) in the broker’s other cliques. In each clique,
the broker faces the expectation from friends to be
honest and open, to share confidences, and to keep
such disclosures confidential (Bridge & Baxter, 1992).
Establishing and maintaining friendships generally
requires significant investments of support and attention that can prove fatiguing (Methot et al.,
2016). The demands placed on Simmelian brokers
to maintain separate sets of friendship relations can
accentuate the conflicting expectations and energy
depletion characteristic of workplace friendships
(Methot et al., 2016).
Even if cliques share similar norms and values, the
Simmelian broker is likely to face expectations by
each set of friends to spend time with and give attention to one set of friends rather than another, to
favor one set over the other, and to be transparent and
confidential—expectations that contribute to the
mixed blessings of friendship (Methot et al., 2016;
Shackelford & Buss, 1996). If trust is to be maintained
in the eyes of one particular clique, the Simmelian
broker is expected to exhibit altruistic behavior toward the members of that clique rather than investing
time, resources, and effort in one ormore other cliques
(McAllister, 1995; Shackelford & Buss, 1996).
We illustrate how Simmelian brokerage differs from
other types of structural arrangements in Figure 1. The
figure shows person Ras a member of three cliques that
would be disconnected but for R’s multiple insider
status. Person R is, therefore, a Simmelian broker in
being the only person who connects multiple cliques.
804 Academy of Management Journal June
Person R’s attitudes and behavior are subject to
scrutiny by a range of coworkers whose views can
influence how much trust interaction partners
place in R (Ferrin et al., 2006). By contrast, person K
is one of two people who connect across the three
cliques to which he or she belongs. Person K is,
therefore, not a Simmelian broker because he or she is
not unique in the role he or she plays in helping to
broker across partly overlapping groups. Note that
person J in the figure has no brokerage role at all, but is
captured within a single clique. Our theory and our
empirical analyses focus on the situations faced by
Simmelian brokers such as R, not on the situation of
people like J or K who occupy different structural
positions thanR. We ask: How, given the pressures on
people (like R) in Simmelian brokerage roles, are
personality differences likely to affect who is trusted?
Personality–Network Fit
Personality theory concerning Simmelian brokerage
is scant or nonexistent, so we offer a new theoretical
approach that is guided by ideas from personality
theory and research. Multiple clique memberships,
of the kind that actor R experiences, are likely, we
suggest, to activate different personality expressions
(e.g., Colbert & Witt, 2009; Tett & Guterman, 2000)
depending on individuals’ personality profiles (e.g.,
Mischel & Shoda, 1995). The experience of having to
juggle scarce time and attention across interpersonal situations (e.g., Stanko & Beckman, 2015) is
likely to prompt individuals to exhibit characteristic
coping behaviors. Some individuals, we suggest, will
respond to multiple cliques with flexible adjustment to
the differing needs of the clique members (i.e., high
self-monitoring) and inhibited verbal expressiveness
(i.e., low blirtatiousness). These trait-related behaviors
are likely to represent a good fit with the demands of
the multiple-clique structure, thereby providing a
positive experience to the individual (e.g., KristofBrown, Jansen, & Colbert, 2002: 985) and providing
evidence of the good citizenship behavior that enhances and maintains trust (McAllister, 1995). Based
on person–organization fit research (see Kristof, 1996,

for a review), we suggest that a fit between the individual and the network structure occurs when there is
compatibility between the individual and the surrounding network such that the individual has the
abilities required to meet situational demands (Kristof,
1996: 3). Some individuals, we suggest, will experience the Simmelian brokerage position as an opportunity to liberate aspects of their personality that
otherwise might remain relatively unused. Other individuals will respond with trait-related behaviors that
are ill-suited to the demands of a multiple-clique situation. They will lose clique members’ trust to the
extent that they fail to detect and adjust behavior to the
differing requirements of different interpersonal situations, and are seen as talking uninhibitedly about
matters that clique members consider should be kept
private.
Self-monitoring. Self-monitoring theory is familiar
to social network researchers (e.g., Kilduff, 1992;
Mehra, Kilduff, & Brass, 2001). The self-monitoring
construct has emerged across studies as the strongest
personality predictor of who occupies roles of structural advantage (Fang et al., 2015). Indeed, selfmonitoring has been described as “a psychological
analogue to bridging structural holes” (Burt, 2012:
548). Relative to low self-monitors, high self-monitors
are predisposed to act out potentially incompatible
roles with distinct groups (Snyder, 1987: 62–63), they
are skilled in social interactions (Furnham & Capon,
1983), and they emerge as informal leaders in organizations (Kilduff, Mehra, Gioia, & Borgatti, 2016).
A Simmelian broker is the only person who connects
otherwise unconnected cliques. The demands of this
multiple insider role, connecting people across multiple cliques, represents a good fit with the high selfmonitor’s boundary-spanning ability (e.g., Caldwell &
O’Reilly, 1982) to flexibly adjust to the demands of
different situations (e.g., Zaccaro, Foti, & Kenny, 1991).
High self-monitors accurately perceive relationships
within social networks (Flynn, Reagans, Amanatullah,
& Ames, 2006), provide help to colleagues in need
(Toegel, Anand, & Kilduff, 2007), and are skilled at
maintaining positive impressions across different
groups (Flynn, Chatman, & Spataro, 2001). Thus, high
self-monitors in the Simmelian brokerage role (relative
to low self-monitors in this role) are likely to maintain
their social standing, including their colleagues’ trust,
despite their membership in multiple cliques.
In contrast, low self-monitors (relative to high selfmonitors) are likely to win the trust of their colleagues
when the structural situation consists of membership in
a single clique. The expression of authentic attitudes
and behaviors with little regard for impression
management—characteristic of the low self-monitoring
orientation—is likely to represent a good fit with the
structural situation of being captured within a single
clique of like-minded friends. Low self-monitors are
likely to gain trust within single cliques because of their
evident authenticity: they choose to be in social situations that are congruent with their underlying dispositions (Snyder & Gangestad, 1982). With respect to
friendship, research in self-monitoring has noted that
“low self-monitoring individuals seek to maximize
the fit between their friends and their own personal attributes” (Snyder & Simpson, 1984:1281). Low selfmonitors (relative to high self-monitors) are likely to
engage in more frequent interaction within the clique
with their friends (Snyder & Simpson, 1984), and thus
gain trust (McAllister, 1995). Low self-monitors commit
themselves to their friends across a range of different
activities, whereas high self-monitors are less committed to relationships in general (e.g., Kilduff & Day, 1994;
Norris & Zweigenhaft, 1999; Snyder & Simpson, 1984)
and choose activity partners on the basis of their skills
for particular activities rather than on the basis of liking
(Snyder & Simpson, 1984).
Thus, high self-monitors are likely to overcome the
lack of trust endemic to the Simmelian brokerage
role but to suffer a lack of trust to the extent that their
friendship relations are restricted to a single clique.
Past research has failed to find a significant interaction between self-monitoring and network position
with respect to outcome measures (e.g., Mehra et al.,
2001). Therefore, we break new ground in anticipating that colleagues’ trust will be influenced by
the interaction between self-monitoring personality
orientation and the extent to which individuals
broker between multiple, disconnected friendship
cliques.
Hypothesis 1. The more the individual’s friendships
span across disconnected cliques, the greater the
positive effect that a high self-monitoring orientation
has on how much the individual is trusted by others.
Blirtatiousness. A separate question of fit refers to
how the structural situation of Simmelian brokerage
relates to differences in the speed of self-revelation.
Some individuals engage in rapid, frequent, and effusive
communication that reveals thoughts, feelings, and attitudes to others (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001). High blirters, or verbal disinhibitors, tend to express themselves as
soon as thoughts occur to them, whereas low blirters, or
verbal inhibitors, are relatively slow and inhibited in
responding to others (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001; Swann,
Rentfrow, & Gosling, 2003), whether the interaction
is affectively neutral (for example, conversation in
806 Academy of Management Journal June
a classroom) or contentious (such as confrontation during a phone call).
There are several positive aspects to the blirtatious, rapid verbal-responding propensity. High
blirters, relative to low blirters, are seen as more intelligent, more likable, more physically attractive,
and more interesting. They deal with annoying interactions with more humor, and exhibit less stress
(Swann & Rentfrow, 2001). People high in blirtatiousness are easier to get to know because their good
and bad characteristics are amplified (Swann &
Rentfrow, 2001). However, blirtatiousness can lead
to impulsive verbal outbursts, particularly in response to provocation (Park, Ickes, & Robinson,
2014). Because blirtatiousness amplifies individuals’ reactions, it is easier for third parties to infer
negative emotional states, including irritation, of
high than of low blirters (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001:
1172). Moreover, third parties might consider the
speediness and effusiveness of high blirters as inappropriate for professional contexts, and thus report that they give away secrets and fail to display
necessary discretion and diplomacy (Swann et al.,
2003).
Most of the research on blirtatiousness relates either to couples’ therapy (Sellers, Woolsey, & Swann,
2007; Swann, McClarty, & Rentfrow, 2007; Swann
et al., 2003) or to consumer behavior (Bolkan &
Goodboy, 2011). However, no research has looked at
blirtatiousness in organizational contexts or related
blirtatiousness to brokerage or trust.
From a personality–network fit perspective, high
blirters in Simmelian brokerage roles are likely to impair the trust of their colleagues. A major challenge
for the Simmelian broker is to act with discretion in
terms of being seen by friends in both cliques as likely
to keep, rather than reveal, secrets. Such discretion
with respect to confidential information is a contributing factor to the maintenance of trust (e.g., Abrams
et al., 2003). The high blirter is likely to suffer censure
in moving from one clique to another for failing to
control verbal expression when socially required to do
so (Swann et al., 2003). However, for high blirters who
are members of single cliques, there is an opportunity
to build trust through the transparency of frequent
communication with clique members (Abrams et al.,
2003). Thus, low blirtatiousness is likely to represent
a good fit with the requirements of the Simmelian
brokerage role, whereas high blirtatiousness is likely
to represent a good fit with the requirements of membership in a single clique. Overall, therefore, the prediction is that the more that the situation calls for
brokerage between unconnected cliques, the greater
the advantage that low blirters will have in maintaining trust.
Hypothesis 2. The more the individual’s friendships
span across disconnected cliques, the greater the
positive effect that a low blirtatiousness orientation
has on how much the individual is trusted by others.
Combining the traits. The first two hypotheses
summarize the separate cases for the relevance of selfmonitoring and blirtatiousness in explaining trust in
Simmelian brokers. However, individuals who combine high self-monitoring and low blirtatiousness are
likely, we argue, to represent an enhanced fit with the
trust requirements of the Simmelian brokerage role. For
example, the high self-monitoring tendency to speak
first in social interactions (Ickes & Barnes, 1977) may be
curbed in people with low blirtatiousness. The high
self-monitors may encourage communication through
the nonverbal expression of emotion (Friedman &
Miller-Herringer, 1991) as part of their characteristic
effort to make social interactions succeed (Ickes,
Holloway, Stinson, & Hoodenpyle, 2006). The high
self-monitor, low blirter flexibly presents across different cliques but does so guardedly so as to limit thirdparty gossip. Of course, there are other possible
combinations of these two personality orientations.
The high self-monitor, high blirter flexibly presents
feelings, attitudes, and ideas across different cliques,
but does so effusively.The lowself-monitor, high blirter
is effusive in revealing current emotions, attitudes, and
ideas to different cliques. The low self-monitor, low
blirter avoids the limelight, sticks with the same enduring self-presentation, and suffers verbal inhibition.
We summarize these four personality styles in Figure 2.
The time, resource, and confidentiality requirements
of Simmelian brokerage across different cliques are likely
to represent a match with the traits that people who
combine high self-monitoring and low blirtatiousness
offer in terms of their talents for flexible self-presentation
and discretion in self-revelation. The Simmelian brokerage situation places the individual as the sole representative of each clique to the other. This situation calls
for a diplomatic personality style that combines the high
self-monitor’s flexible adjustment to the demands of each
clique, and the low blirter’s restricted effusiveness when
it comes to sharing confidential information. There is
also a match between personality and situation for individuals low in self-monitoring and high in blirtatiousness whose activities are restricted within cliques. Being
enclosed within a group of mutual friendship relationships is likely to allow these authentic-seeming, talkative individuals to express their innermost feelings
and ideas to likeminded others (Snyder, 1974). Their
2018 Tasselli and Kilduff 807
blirtatiousness (which amplifies their distinctive characteristics [Swann & Rentfrow, 2001]) is likely to be encouraged given that their loyalties are to just one set of
friends. They are likely to gain trust with their friends as
long as they are “blirting” within, and not across, cliques.
Therefore, we see trust accruing to those in situations
of both high and low Simmelian brokerage, depending
on individuals’ levels of self-monitoring and blirtatiousness. An individual who belongs to several otherwise disconnected friendship cliques (representative
of a high level of Simmelian brokerage) is likely to be
trusted by friends across these different cliques if the
cross-pressures are matched by a diplomatic personality style that combines high self-monitoring and low
blirtatiousness. This diplomatic personality style involves the appropriate adjustment of self-presentation
and the avoidance of inappropriate self-revelation to the
different constituencies to which the individual belongs. An individual whose friendships are restricted to
a cohesive group of mutual friends (representative of
a low level of Simmelian brokerage) is likely to be
trusted by these interconnected friends if the pressure to
be authentic is matched by a personality style characterized by a transparent, principled presentation of self.
Hypothesis 3. There is a three-way interaction among
Simmelian brokerage, self-monitoring, and blirtatiousness in the friendship network. When the individual’s friendships span across many disconnected
cliques, the higher the self-monitoring score, and the
lower the blirtatiousness score, the more the individual
is trusted; when the individual’s friendships span
across few or no disconnected cliques, the lower the
self-monitoring score, and the higher the blirtatiousness score, the more the individual is trusted.
It is less clear how the other two combinations of
individual differences might represent a fit with
structural conditions with implications for trust. We
speculate, however, that the Simmelian brokerage
role may trigger in high self-monitors who are also
high blirters an effusiveness toward the expectations
of different audiences that may remedy the lack of
trust that might otherwise compromise their performance in the Simmelian brokerage role. Similarly, to
the extent that the Simmelian brokerage role requires
discretion, individuals characterized by low selfmonitoring and low blirting may exhibit verbal inhibition that protects individuals from low trust.
We tested these ideas in two settings in which relations of trust are important: a graduate program for
young professionals intent on trying to build and maintain their reputations with peers in the process of career
transition (Master’s sample); and a hospital setting in
which medical staff rely on trust with fellow professionals to implement critical care (Hospital sample).
METHODS
Participants
Master’s sample. We surveyed 148 members of a
full-time, two-year European business school master’s
degree program designed for those transitioning to
business careers whose first degrees were mainly in
nonbusiness subjects, such as social science, politics,
economics, and law.We presented people with a paperbased questionnaire during the third semester and 126
people (i.e., 85%) responded (average work experience
5 2.31 years). We analyzed data from the program’s
administrative office and found no statistical difference between respondents and nonrespondents on
age, gender, class section, or citizenship.
Hospital. We surveyed 84 professionals employed
in a critical-care unit of a publicly funded European

hospital. Work involved diagnosis, surgical intervention, pharmaceutical care, and continuous
checks of patients’ health conditions. Seventy-five
people (20 doctors, 39 nurses, 16 paramedical staff)
responded to a paper-based questionnaire (response
rate 5 89%). We analyzed the administrative data
and found no statistical difference between respondents and nonrespondents on demographic,
organizational, or professional variables.
Network Data
Across both samples, we used the roster method to
collect network data (Wasserman & Faust, 1994: 46);
this approach reduces the likelihood that respondents forget important contacts (Marsden, 2011:
372). Each respondent was presented with a complete alphabetical list of all those in the relevant
master’s or hospital network and asked to indicate
the names of “people you consider as ‘friends’—that
is, people with whom you frequently and regularly
have friendly and pleasant relationships during
classes and during your stay at the business school”
(Master’s sample) or “...during your stay at work”
(Hospital sample).
Consistent with the definition of Simmelian ties as
“super strong and sticky” (Krackhardt, 1998:21), we
restricted the analysis to reciprocated relations between individuals who were embedded in friendship
cliques. Specifically, we only included relations between those individuals who met both of the following
two conditions: they expressed reciprocated friendship for each other (i.e., theirs was a strong relationship), and there was at least one other person in the
dataset who reciprocated each of their friendships
(i.e., theirs was a sticky relationship in that it involved
a mutual friend who could mediate between them).
Thus, across both samples we excluded from the final
database all unreciprocated friendship ties and all ties
that were not tied to at least one common third party.
Technically, we symmetrized the friendship matrix using the interaction rule: a friendship link between two people was defined as existing only when
it was reciprocated by both people (Krackhardt,
1998). The symmetrized matrix included 1,063 ties
in the Master’s sample (78% of total ties) and 589 ties
in the Hospital sample (75% of total ties). From the
symmetrized matrix, we identified 168 cliques involving 108 individuals in the Master’s sample and
109 cliques between 68 individuals in the Hospital
sample using the clique indicator matrix procedure
in the statistical package UCINET VI (Borgatti,
Everett, & Freeman, 2002), with each single clique
having at least three members all reciprocally tied
to each other. The final datasets included only reciprocated friendship ties embedded in cliques: 692
ties involving 108 people (Master’s sample) and 418
ties involving 68 people (Hospital sample).
Independent variables. For Simmelian brokerage, we considered the number of times an actor
played an exclusive brokerage role between otherwise disconnected friendship cliques. For example,
an actor spanning across the single gap between two
otherwise disconnected cliques would have a Simmelian brokerage score 5 1. In Figure 1, R brokers
across three gaps between three otherwise disconnected cliques, so R’s Simmelian brokerage score 5
3. In addition, brokerage across four otherwise disconnected cliques involves spanning across the six
possible relations between the four cliques, so the
Simmelian brokerage score would equal 6. In summary, consistent with the definition of Simmelian
brokerage as strongly and reciprocally connecting
at least two cliques such that no member of one clique except the broker is directly connected to any
member of the other clique (Krackhardt, 1999), we
considered an individual to be a Simmelian broker
only when spanning between nonoverlapping cliques. In Figure 1, therefore,Kbelongs to three cliques
that are also connected through another actor; thus,
the Simmelian brokerage score for K 5 0. We assessed
Simmelian brokerage from the clique census procedure in UCINET VI (Borgatti et al., 2002).
We repeated the analysis, assessing Simmelian
brokerage as the number of otherwise disconnected
cliques to which an individual belongs. If a person
belonged to two otherwise unconnected cliques, we
considered his or her brokerage score as 2, and so on.
Results were unchanged.
Our theory of personality–network fit applies to situations of Simmelian brokerage; i.e., situations that
involve people (such as R in Figure 1) who are the
sole links between otherwise disconnected cliques
(Krackhardt, 1999). We assessed whether our results
would hold for two other measures that, as Figure 1 illustrates, also differentiate between Simmelian and
other types of brokerage. Betweenness centrality assesses the extent to which an actor serves as a potential
go-between for other pairs of actors by occupying an
intermediary position on the shortest paths connecting
other actors across the whole network, including both
direct and indirect relationships (Freeman, 1979). Ego
betweenness centrality assesses the extent to which an
actor serves as a potential go-between for other pairs of
actors to whom the focal actor is only directly connected (Everett & Borgatti, 2005). Using either of these
2018 Tasselli and Kilduff 809
measures, Simmelian brokers consistently show higher
brokerage scores than non-Simmelian brokers (as illustrated in Figure 1). Across the two datasets, analyses
using either betweenness centrality or ego betweenness
centrality showed the same patterns of results as those
found using the Simmelian brokerage measure.
For self-monitoring, we used the 18-item true–false
scale (Gangestad & Snyder, 1985; Snyder & Gangestad,
1986) (Kuder–Richardson reliability:Master’s sample5
.77, Hospital sample 5 .69). For blirtatiousness,we used
the eight-item BLIRT scale (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001;
Cronbach’sa:Master’s sample5 .85,Hospital sample5
.79). Five-point Likert scale items included “If I have
something to say, I don’t hesitate to say it” and “I always
say what’s on my mind.”
Dependent variable. The dependent variable was
the extent of affect-based trust from one person (the
rater) to another (the ratee). Affect-based trust is the
extent to which the individual is perceived to be genuine in showing interpersonal care and concern for
colleagues (McAllister, 1995). We focused on affectbased trust (rather than cognitive-based trust) because
of its critical role in facilitating managerial working
relationships (McAllister, 1995). Warmth judgments
are made more swiftly than competence judgments and
have a larger effect on how we see others (Wojciszke &
Abele, 2008). Affect-based trust improves the usefulness of both tacit and explicit knowledge exchange
(Levin & Cross, 2004) and is characteristic of the communal interpersonal relations that characterize friendship cliques (McAllister, 1995).
In each clique, there were at least three members,
with all clique members reciprocally tied to each other
(e.g., Tortoriello & Krackhardt, 2010). Each rater,
therefore, provided a trust score for at least two ratees,
and each ratee received, in turn, at least two trust
scores from raters. The trust score was constructed as
the mean of five items with anchors of 1 (strongly
disagree) and 7 (strongly agree) (McAllister, 1995;
Cronbach’s a: Master’s sample 5 .92, Hospital sample 5 .85). Scale items (adapted in the Master’s sample
for use in an academic context) included “If I shared
my problems with this person, I know (s)he would
respond constructively and caringly.” Thus, for each
ratee we computed two or more affect-based trust
scores representing the levels of trust accorded to the
ratee by fellow clique members, a procedure similar to
that used for relational measures in prior research
(e.g., Reagans & McEvily, 2003: 249). Based on this
procedure, for the Master’s sample we computed
692 trust scores (provided by 108 people), and for
the Hospital sample we computed 418 trust scores
(provided by 68 people). To deal with issues of
nonindependence of these scores (given that each individual both provided, and was the target of, two or
more scores) we used linear regression models with
error terms clustered around individual IDs; and we
checked results with other approaches, as described
in the Analysis section.
Control variables. Some individuals may be
trusted more than others because of their better
performance (Colquitt, Scott, & LePine, 2007). In the
Master’s sample, we assessed performance as the
arithmetic mean of each student’s marks across
the 10 classes taken by all students during the first
year of the Master’s sample (normalized range:
1–100). At the conclusion of each of these common
classes, students could access not only their own
scores but also the scores of other class members. In
the Hospital sample, the three head supervisors (one
for each professional function) evaluated each subordinate’s performance with a five-point Likert scale
on the three items used in Mehra et al. (2001: 132),
including “the overall job performance of the individual” (1 5 poor, 5 5 excellent; Cronbach’s a: .84).
The number of friends that an individual has may
be an indicator of how much the person is trusted by
others (McAllister, 1995). In both samples, we controlled for each participant’s number of friends in
terms of network size (Freeman, 1979).
In the Hospital sample, we controlled for three
aspects of organizational position that might affect
affiliation patterns or trust. First, we coded for rank
(0 5 nonsupervisor, 1 5 supervisor or manager)
given that rank relates to social status, and, thus, the
extent to which people are trusted (e.g., Oh, Chung, &
Labianca, 2004). Second, we used a dummy variable
to represent the three types of professional function
(doctor 5 A; nurse 5 B; paramedical staff 5 C, serving as the reference category in the models). Third,
we measured organizational tenure as the number of
years each respondent had been in the organization
(Mehra et al., 2001).
The length of time over which people interact may
affect perceptions of trust (Lewicki & Stevenson,
1997), and the more frequently people interact, the
more information they gain about each other, thus
affecting trust development (Lewicki, Tomlinson, &
Gillespie, 2006). The repetition of cooperative exchange promotes trust (Burt, 1999: 215). In the
Master’s sample, therefore, for each friend listed by
a respondent, we measured both relationship duration as the number of years the respondent had
known the classmate, and frequency of interaction
with each friend, with anchors labeled 1 (infrequent
interaction) and 4 (daily interaction).
810 Academy of Management Journal June
We controlled for several proximity factors that
could affect interactions. In the Master’s sample, we
coded for on-campus residence (“1”) and off-campus
residence (“0”) (Festinger, Back, & Schachter, 1950);
whether each person had attended a previous program (“1”) or not (“0”) at the same school; and
whether each friendship pair belonged to the same
section (“1”) or not (“0”) at the moment of data collection (e.g., Feiler & Kleinbaum, 2015). Students
were randomly assigned each semester to one of two
class sections that met in different lecture rooms.
However, activities were conducted with classmates
across the entire cohort rather than within each
section.
We controlled for demographic variables including each individual’s age (as a continuous variable in years) at the time of data collection (e.g., Van
de Bunt, Van Duijn, & Snijders, 1999); gender (0 5
male, 1 5 female) (e.g., Brass, 1985); and, in the
Master’s sample, whether individuals had the citizenship right to work within the European Union
(0 5 non-European citizen, 1 5 European citizen)
(e.g., Kilduff, 1992).
Finally, in the Hospital sample we also collected the
10-item short version of the Big Five Personality Inventory (Rammstedt & John, 2007), which included
two items per factor (anchors: 1 5 disagree strongly,
5 5 agree strongly) to control for extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness,
and emotional stability (McCrae & John 1992). For all
analyses that included the Big-Five variables, the pattern of results remained unchanged. For parsimony in
presenting the findings, we omitted these variables
from the analyses reported in the results section.
Analysis
The dependent variable was affect-based trust. We
analyzed a total of 692 clique-embedded friendship
ties involving 108 people in the Master’s sample; the
equivalent numbers for the Hospital were 418 cliqueembedded friendship ties involving 68 people.
There were multiple measures of each ratee’s trust
from clique members, and each rater provided
multiple measures of trust, one for each clique comember. Standard statistical tests are not appropriate for these data because the dyadic observations
cannot be assumed to be independent. The analyses
may exhibit substantial bias (Kilduff & Krackhardt,
1994) due to autocorrelation: error terms may be
correlated across observations both from the same
source (the rater) and object (the ratee) of the relationship, as noted in prior network research using
a dyadic-based dependent variable (Kilduff, 1990).
We used linear regression models with error terms
clustered around the individual IDs of both the raters
and the ratees to control for nonindependence of the
trust observations (e.g., Reagans & McEvily, 2003).
The estimates of the coefficients are the same as the
ordinary least square (OLS) estimates, but tend to
be more conservative because they generate larger
standard errors that better reflect the sampling
error in the pooled linear regression coefficients
(Wooldridge, 2015: 483; see Huckman & Pisano,
2006 for an example).
To test for robustness and possible additional sources
of heteroskedasticity and endogeneity, we also analyzed the data using other approaches. First,we ran OLS
regression models with a dummy variable that corresponded to each respondent. Results remained unchanged in both studies (e.g., Levin & Cross, 2004).
Second, because in the dyadic analysis individualswith
more ties may be overrepresented in the sample compared to individuals with fewer ties (e.g., Feiler &
Kleinbaum, 2015), we repeated the analysis at the individual level, adopting Tobit regression models and
taking into account as the dependent variable, for each
individual, the average level of trust assigned by friends.
Across both samples, the pattern of results remained
confirmed; in addition, t-tests showed no significant mean differences at the dyadic level versus
the individual level for the demographic or personality characteristics of individuals (i.e., gender, age,
tenure, self-monitoring, blirtatiousness). Third, we
used another approach that controls for unobserved
heterogeneity in the data and nonindependence of
observations—the exponential random graph model
(ERGM) framework (e.g., Carnabuci & Dioszegi, 2015; ´
Lusher, Koskinen, & Robins, 2012). This approach
makes no assumptions about the nonindependence of
actors or ties (Cranmer & Desmarais, 2011), although it
requires binary data as input. We reran the hypothesis
tests with the dependent variable structured as the
likelihood of receiving a trust tie from another participant. In both studies, we considered a trust tie from
i to j to exist when i assigned a mean trust score to
j of 5 or more on the seven-point affect-based trust
scale. The results paralleled those we present below.
To assess interaction effects, in each model interaction terms were entered in a separate step after
the main terms were entered. To correct for the
multicollinearity that can arise when testing moderated relationships among continuous variables,
independent and interaction variables were centered before generating interaction terms (Aiken &
West, 1991).
2018 Tasselli and Kilduff 811
Despite the clear conceptual distinction between the
size of the individual’s network and the extent to which
individuals are brokers between cliques, size and brokerage tend to be highly correlated (Bonacich, Oliver, &
Snijders,1998: 135;Mehra et al., 2001) and were so both
in the Master’s sample (r 5 .82; p , .01) and in the
Hospital sample (r 5 .81; p , .01). People with many
friends tend to have high brokerage scores. Collinearity
between variables can inflate the standard errors of their
regression coefficients. To check the severity of multicollinearity, we examined the conditioning index and
variance proportions associatedwith each independent
and control variable (e.g., Belsley, Kuh, & Welsch,
1980). According to Tabachnick and Fidell (1996: 89),
a conditioning index greater than 30 and variance inflation factors higher than 10 can indicate serious
multicollinearity. None of the independent variables
violated this criterion; there was thus no serious threat
to the significance of each independent variable. To
further check for possible effects of collinearity, we
repeated the models across both samples, dropping
network size from the analysis. Results remained
unchanged.
RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 present means and standard deviations for the two samples. The two personality
variables (self-monitoring and blirtatiousness) were
not significantly correlated with each other (Master’s
sample, r 5 2.10, n.s.; Hospital sample, r 5 2.04,
n.s.). We also note that the independent variables
exhibited a suitable range of scores. Self-monitoring
scores (which can vary from 0–18) ranged from 2–18
(Master’s sample) and 3–16 (Hospital sample). Blirtatiousness scores (which can range from 8–40)
ranged from 9–34 (Master’s sample) and 13–28
(Hospital sample). Simmelian brokerage scores
ranged from 0–21 (Master’s sample), and from 0–6
(Hospital sample).
The results of regression models are reported in
Tables 3 and 4. Recall that Hypothesis 1 suggested
that the greater the individual’s Simmelian brokerage (as measured by the number of the individual’s
exclusive bridging roles between otherwise disconnected friendship cliques), the greater the positive
effect of a high self-monitoring orientation on how
much the individual is trusted by others. This hypothesis was supported. For the Master’s sample, as
shown in Model 2 in Table 3, with all controls in
place, the interaction between self-monitoring and
Simmelian brokerage (B 5 .19, p , .01) improved
variance explained by 4% (R2 5 .35, p , .01) over the
direct-effects Model 1 (R2 5 .31, p , .01). For the
Hospital sample, as shown in Model 3 in Table 4,
the interaction of self-monitoring and Simmelian
brokerage (B 5 .58, p , .01) improved explained
variance by 8% (R2 5 .36, p , .01) over Model 2 (R2 5
.28, p , .01). To interpret these results, we plotted the
predicted values of affect-based trust using 6 two
standard deviations to represent high and low values
of variables. As illustrated in Figure 3, in both samples a simple slope test showed that the predicted
positive relationship between levels of self-monitoring
and trust was significantly evident for those with
high Simmelian brokerage scores (Master’s, t 5 4.07,
p , .01; Hospital, t 5 3.28, p , .01); but for those with
low brokerage scores, the relationship between selfmonitoring and trust was either negative (Hospital,
t 5 22.83, p , .01), or significant at p , .10 and negative (Master’s, t 5 21.68, p , .10).
Thus, we found support for the hypothesized fit
between self-monitoring and the situation of brokering between disconnected cliques: people who
flexibly represent themselves are trusted in the role
of Simmelian broker. Did we find a similar pattern
with respect to blirtatiousness—i.e., the verbal effusiveness with which people respond to social situations? Recall that Hypothesis 2 suggested a trust
advantage for Simmelian brokers who were low
blirters rather than high blirters: the greater the individual’s Simmelian brokerage, the greater the
positive effect of a low-blirtatiousness orientation on
how much the individual is trusted by others. This
hypothesis was supported. For the Master’s sample,
as shown in Model 3 in Table 3, with controls in
place, the interaction between blirtatiousness and
Simmelian brokerage (B 5 2.24, p , .01) improved
variance explained by 9% (R2 5 .40, p , .01) over the
direct-effects Model 1 (R2 5 .31, p , .01). For the
Hospital sample, as shown in Model 4 of Table 4,
the interaction between blirtatiousness and Simmelian brokerage (B 5 2.43, p , .05) improved
explained variance by 5% (R2 5 .33, p , .01) over
Model 2, which included only independent variables and controls (R2 5 .28, p , .01). To interpret
this result, we plotted the predicted values of affectbased trust for high and low levels of the variables in
both samples. As illustrated in Figure 4, a simple
slope test showed that the predicted negative relationship between blirtatiousness and trust was
significantly evident for those with high Simmelian
brokerage scores (Master’s, t 5 25.75, p , .01; Hospital, t 5 22.16, p , .05), but the relationship between levels of blirtatiousness and trust for those
with low Simmelian brokerage scores was either

positive (Master’s, t 5 3.61, p , .01), or significant at

Thus, we found support for the predicted fit between
low blirtatiousness and the situation of brokering
between disconnected cliques: the more individuals’
friendships span across cliques, the more they are
trusted to the extent that they control verbal
expressiveness.
Hypothesis 3 posited a three-way interaction between Simmelian brokerage, self-monitoring and
blirtatiousness in affecting the extent to which people are trusted. The results show support for this

the relevant two-way interactions (R2 5 .42, p , .01).
For the Hospital sample, as shown in Table 4, Model 6,
the three-way interaction of Simmelian brokerage, selfmonitoring, and blirtatiousness (B 5 .09, p , .05) improved variance explained by 2% (R2 5 .55, p , .01)
over Model 5’s test of the relevant two-way interactions
(R2 5 .53, p , .01). The combination of personality
traits, therefore, represented a better fit with the Simmelian brokerage role than did either personality trait
by itself.
To illustrate the result, we show in Figure 5 that the
highest levels of trust were found to be as expected
for those Simmelian brokers who exhibited a diplomatic personality style: high self-monitoring combined with low blirtatiousness (Master’s sample,
M 5 5.48; Hospital,M5 4.15); and for those nonbrokers
who exhibited a forthright, effusive personality style
that combined low self-monitoring with high blirtatiousness (Master’s sample, M 5 4.51; Hospital, M 5
3.92). A simple slope test showed that both the slope
of the high self-monitoring, low blirters (Master’s
sample, t 5 2.11, p , .05; Hospital, t 5 2.19, p , .05)
and the slope of the low self-monitoring, high blirters
(Master’s sample, t 5 24.94, p , .01; Hospital, t 5
24.39, p , .01) were significant in the two samples.
A question remains, however, concerning the extent
to which other personality combinations represented
a fit with aspects of the Simmelian brokerage role. A
pairwise comparison of the slopes reported in Figure 5
(Dawson & Richter, 2006) shows that the slopes of those
brokers combining high self-monitoring and low blirtatiousness (line 2) were different from the slopes of
those brokers combining low self-monitoring and high
blirtatiousness (line 3; Master’s sample, t 5 5.62, p ,
.01; Hospital, t 5 5.03, p , .01) and from the slopes
of those high in brokerage combining high selfmonitoring and high blirtatiousness (line 1; Master’s
sample, t 5 21.44, p , .10; Hospital, t 5 22.01, p ,
.05). The pattern of results suggests that a high-blirting
orientation represented a poor fit with the requirements
of the Simmelian brokerage role irrespective of the individual’s self-monitoring orientation.
