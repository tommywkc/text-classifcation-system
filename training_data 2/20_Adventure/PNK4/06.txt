The rapid growth of adventure travel is now represented by a wide variety of adventure travel activities but has not been fully recognized as a topic for empirical research to date. This study attempts to segment the adventure travel market by activities as the key products. Data were collected from adventure travel providers (N = 178) through survey questionnaires. The test statistics suggested the inclusion of forty-eight activities in adventure travel. Factor analysis identified six distinctive groupings of adventure travel activities, labeled as: ¡¥soft nature,¡¦ ¡¥risk equipped,¡¦ ¡¥question marks,¡¦ ¡¥hard challenge,¡¦ ¡¥rugged   Heidi Y.

Adventure travel activities, market segmentation, fac- tor analysisINTRODUCTION  Adventure travel has broadened in scope and appeal in international tour- ism since the late 1970s. The growing importance of this segment is repre- sented by an ¡¥¡¥enormous variety and availability of adventure travel prod- ucts¡¦¡¦ (Sung, Morrison, & O¡¦Leary, 1997) in the global marketplace. Supported by major socioeconomic and demographic changes, such as great- ly increased leisure time and disposable income for billions of people world- wide, adventure travel today is now recognized as one of the fastest growing segments of the international tourism industry (Chon & Singh, 1995; Jeffer- son, 1995; Loverseed, 1997; Sorensen, 1993; Tourism Canada, 1995; Travel Industry Association of America, 1998; Weiler & Hall, 1992). For example, Loverseed (1997) asserted that ¡¥¡¥adventure travel is the fastest growing seg- ment of the tourism industry in North America.¡¦¡¦  The North American market, the largest generator of the international tourism payments for both expenditures and receipts at approximately $67 billion and $58 billion in 1995 respectively (World Tourism Organization, 1995 cited in World Travel Atlas, 1997-1998), appears to have been leading the adventure travel trend. In Canada, adventure travel generated approxi- mately $165.1 million in revenues in 1993, which was a 12.9 percent increase over 1992 and almost 4.5 times the overall Gross Domestic Product growth rate of 2.9 percent during the same period. According to the 1994 National Travel Survey, ¡¥¡¥over 73 million adult North Americans have taken adventure vacations, and nearly 55 million have taken an adventure vacation within the past 12 months¡¦¡¦ (Tourism Canada, 1995). The Travel Industry Association of America (TIA, 1998), in its Adventure Travel Report, 1997, reported that 98 million U.S. adults (about half of the entire adult population) had taken an adventure travel vacation in the past five years.  Despite its significance, relatively little empirical research has been con- ducted on this market segment. A solid conceptual framework to comprehend its theoretical structure in an integrated manner has not supported the rapid growth of adventure travel. Considering the dynamic nature of tourism, it
will be challenging for researchers in adventure travel to identify a common conceptual framework upon which empirical research can be based. More- over, studies of adventure travel should be careful not to focus too much on the numerous sub-segments by the scale of companies and types of products available in this heavily industry-driven segment. In adventure travel, it can be argued that how and with which criteria adventure traveler segments are identified will influence what needs to be researched. A recent study (Sung et al., 1997) proposed a definition of adventure travel as a standard measure- ment tool. The Canadian Tourism Commission (Loverseed, 1997) has also provided a new definition of adventure travel. Both of these alternative defi- nitions remain to be empirically tested.  Adventure travel appears to have developed out of the broader growth of traditional outdoor and wilderness recreation during the 20th century (Ewert, 1989). Also supporting the development of adventure travel has been the growth of journals, magazines, and online Web information such as the Specialty Travel Index Online (http://www.spectrav.com). Although there is little theoretical foundation for measuring adventure travel, it is generally agreed that this is a viable market segment in tourism, which has been recog- nized and developed with the support of industry. As the variety and avail- ability of adventure travel activities to satisfy a wide range of interests and abilities appear to be limitless (Sung et al., 1997), this study argues that activity should be one of the primary bases used to analyze adventure traveler segments. That is, market segmentation should be based upon what adventure travelers do on their vacations, and what is also marketable for adventure travel providers.  For the first time, this study provides an analysis of the adventure travel market and proposes a segmentation approach for adventure travelers. The analysis suggests ways to link adventure travel activities to the marketable products that are currently being provided by organizers, operators, distribu- tors, and promoters of adventure travel. In such a highly dynamic and indus- try-driven segment, adventure travel research will be the most useful when it contributes to empirical application while, at the same time, helping to ad- dress important managerial issues.  For adventure travel providers, using adventure travel activities as a seg- mentation base should also provide an empirical guideline for more effective use of their marketing resources. They should be able to accurately and effectively segment the market and better cater to their target markets. Using this analysis to profile the adventure travel market should also help manage- ment identify major trends and management issues, and thus enhance their effectiveness in formulating business strategies.
REVIEW OF LITERATUREMarket Segmentation Studies in Tourism  As the international tourism market has matured, travelers have become more sophisticated and more traveled with increased leisure time and greater disposable income. Particularly in the North American market, the maturity of the baby boomer generation has greatly altered the socio-demographic profiles of the travelers who are also benefiting from more convenient and accessible travel opportunities. As consumer preferences for travel products have become more diversified and their travel motivations have become more specific (Chon & Singh, 1995; Morrison, Pearce, Moscardo, Nadkarni, & O¡¦Leary, 1996; Moscardo, Morrison, Pearce, Lang, & O¡¦Leary, 1996; Soren- sen, 1993; Weiler & Hall, 1992), tourism marketers have faced increasing challenges to respond to the diversified market niches.  Segmenting the market, sometimes called ¡¥¡¥target market analysis¡¦¡¦ (Mor- rison, 1996), is a cornerstone of an effective marketing strategy. This allows companies to best apply their capabilities through the most appropriate al- location of resources in today¡¦s competitive marketing environment. Target- ing specific customers means identifying homogeneous (Andereck & Cald- well, 1994) groups of people in terms of their needs, desires, attitudes, or behaviors. Targeting requires the company to focus marketing attention on selected groups of customers and to design, tailor, and supply products or services to meet their needs (Kotler, Bowen, & Makens, 1998; Middleton, 1994; Morrison, 1996).  Market segmentation is the first stage in formulating an effective market- ing strategy. The importance of strategic planning from the perspective of tourism marketing research has been emphasized by Athiyaman and Robert- son (1995) and conceptually analyzed by Athiyaman (1995). While assessing resources and promotional efforts, Middleton (1994) emphasizes the efficient use of resources particularly in tourism products. However, care should be taken to avoid excessive expenditures in customized promotional programs when a market is divided into too many small niches (Kotler et al., 1996; Morrison, 1996).  Without a doubt, all customers are not alike. Since it is virtually impossi- ble to satisfy all customers in the same way, it is more reasonable to pinpoint and selectively market only to specific niches to ensure the highest returns without wasting unnecessary marketing dollars and resources. Segmenting the market means dividing the whole market into subgroups (Andereck & Caldwell, 1994) in order to deal with them more effectively and profitably (Jeffrey & Xie, 1995; Middleton, 1994; Morrison, 1996).  It is also true that there is no best variable for segmenting a market, nor is there any set of variables that can be used every time. Either multistage
segmentation (Morrison, 1996) or a combination (Kotler et al., 1998) ap- proach appears to be the most appropriate. The tourism industry is often dealing with fixed products in a confined environment (e.g., a ski resort in Colorado) and, at the same time, with quality and services engaged in dy- namic interactions (e.g., an escorted, packaged motor coach tour). As such, it is no surprise that tourism market segmentation studies must take several variables into account.Market Segmentation Variables  As everybody has individual needs, tastes, or attitudes and is living in a different stage of life in a different style, no single variable can be used to segment a market. The key question becomes how to pinpoint the best seg- mentation bases. How broad or narrow should each segment be? Many au- thors in marketing (Kotler et al., 1998; Middleton, 1994; Morrison, 1996) have suggested several approaches using different variables to divide markets into component segments. Not surprisingly, all seem to point to the use of the combination of multiple variables rather than just one factor.  From the traditional consumer marketing management perspective, Kotler (see also Kotler, 1994) has long been arguing that the major variables for market segmentation purposes should be geographic, demographic, psycho- graphic, and behavioral. Marketing studies in tourism, however, need to address additional factors such as: (1) the service and quality of hospitality,(2) the mobility of traveling consumers; and (3) the interactions arising from these. In order to reflect these unique factors, Morrison (1996) added more categories to Kotler¡¦s basic four including purpose of trip, product-related, and channels of distribution.  As variables are sometimes overlapping and supplement one another, it is hard to identify the most important variables in tourism marketing. As a result, relatively general categories such as geography and demographics (often combined with socioeconomics) have been used as primary segmenta- tion bases in conjunction with factors such as psychographics, behavior, or product-related variables (Morrison, 1996). Channel-of-distribution seg- mentation, for instance, focuses on the marketing distribution channels and appears to require some prerequisite base in order to be used effectively.  Several recent studies in tourism have focused on psychographic variables to identify characteristics of travel behavior for more effective segmentation purposes. These variables have included activities (Hsieh, O¡¦Leary, & Morri- son, 1992; Moscardo et al., 1996; Jeffrey & Xie, 1995; Morrison, Hsieh, & O¡¦Leary, 1994), interests (Sorensen, 1993; Wight, 1996), motivations (Cha, McCleary, & Uysal, 1995; Wight, 1996), opinions (Cohen & Richardson, 1995), and values (Madrigal & Kahle, 1994). Activity segmentation, in par- ticular, has been used in conjunction with other psychographic and/or socio-
demographic variables in order to efficiently and effectively divide, differ- entiate, and describe (Morrison, 1996) target markets.Activity Segmentation in the Adventure Travel Market  Although there still remains some debate on the best approach to effective segmentation, most tourism marketing authors suggest that target markets should be: (1) measurable in terms of size and market potential; (2) accessible for marketing activities; and (3) substantial for investment and profitability (Kotler et al., 1998; Middleton, 1994; Morrison, 1996). In tourism, however, products or resources are more difficult to measure and substantiate (for further argument, see Kotler et al., 1998) due to the greater proportion of services to fixed resources. Therefore, market segmentation in tourism needs to meet additional requirements. As Morrison (1996) argued, effective mar- ket segments should also be (1) defensible; (2) durable; and (3) support a distinct competitive advantage.  In recent tourism research studies, the factor-cluster analysis technique has often been used to support the multistage (Morrison, 1996) or combination (Kotler et al., 1998) approaches. Typical variable sets for factor-cluster analy- sis have included: (1) activity participation¡Vtrip characteristics¡Vmotivation (Cha et al., 1995; Hsieh et al., 1992; Moscardo et al., 1996; and Morrison et al., 1994) and (2) trip experience¡Vmotivation¡Vbenefit¡Vdestination choice (Shoemaker, 1994; Loker & Perdue, 1992).  Similarly, other studies using multidimensional scaling such as trip index (Pearce & Wilson, 1995) and the brand development index (Bonn & Brand, 1995) have focused on behavior variables across trip characteristics to profile market segments. With few exceptions, demographic or socioeconomic vari- ables were used as the primary base. In this context, Andereck and Caldwell (1994) found that behavior variables (i.e., satisfaction and enjoyment) dem- onstrated significant differences among segments while demographic vari- ables displayed little difference.  Hall and Weiler (1992) used 2 ¡Ñ 2 factorial design to analyze the special interest travel market by using primary motive (activity vs. destination) and setting (urban vs. rural) attributes. However, adventure travel, as a special-in- terest market, does not seem to be effectively accommodated by Hall and Weiler¡¦s approach since most adventure travel activities can only be experi- enced in a nature-based environment. It is probable that as activity-oriented travelers develop higher levels of experience, destination choice may play a greater role in their selection of travel products.  The question remains where to start in order to pinpoint the best segmenta- tion bases? In adventure travel, this is particularly a fundamental issue for marketers since the speed of product and market growth has not been matched by theoretical development. The needs of adventure travelers must
be identified prior to establishing appropriate marketing strategies and re- source allocations. Sung et al. (1997) proposed a conceptual framework for adventure travel based upon two major constructs: the notion of adventure from past leisure and recreation studies and its empirical application from the tourism perspective. While trying to define adventure travel, they identified six major components of the notion of adventure (activity, environment, experience, motivation, performance, and risk), and found that activity was the most important variable for defining adventure travel and highly interre- lated with experience and environment.  This is clearly supported by the strong trend towards an increased range of activities with many more opportunities to explore new experiences in exotic or remote settings based upon their natural environments. Adventure travel- ers, still often confused with ecotourists, appear to be a more affluent, envi- ronmentally-concerned, and highly experience-oriented group of people who seek specific experiences strongly associated with activities (Chon & Singh, 1995; Cohen & Richardson, 1995; Weiler & Hall, 1992; Morrison et al., 1996; Oden, 1995; Pearce & Wilson, 1995; Tourism Canada, 1995; Wight,1996).  In using activity as a segmentation base, one underlying hypothesis is that travelers who prefer particular types of activities are likely to be different from others who engage in other types of activities (Hsieh et al., 1992; Jeffrey & Xie, 1995; Morrison et al., 1994; Moscardo et al., 1996). Further, if other factors are added to explain such differences, the results are expected to become even more comprehensive. As such, activity segmentation has often been used in conjunction with motivation, value, and behavior variables to explain group characteristics, as well as with socioeconomic and/or demo- graphic variables.  From a marketing perspective, the ultimate goal is often to attract greater numbers of visitors to purchase tourism products or services in order to generate increased amounts of tourism expenditures. To do this, tourism marketers must understand how their products and services fit with their potential customers¡¦ preferences and decision-making processes. In this light, tourism studies should attempt to explain and predict travelers¡¦ decision- making processes in relation to the choices of destinations and specific tour packages.  In adventure travel, where activity is a major vacation experience as well as a key product component, analyzing activities should lead to more effec- tive use of tourism resources to accurately target appropriate market seg- ments and to be able to link these to the range of tourism products available (Jeffrey & Xie, 1995). Although the exact size of the global adventure travel market is unknown due to definitional problems and a lack of sufficient research to date, it is generally agreed that there are some activities that
belong within the adventure travel category (Ewert, 1989; McMenamin, 1992; Hall, 1992; Specialty Travel Index, 1992). Upon this basis, Sung et al. (1997) suggest 48 activities that are commonly provided by organized and commercial operators which can be considered within the adventure travel concept (Table 1).Research Hypotheses  This study provided an analysis for segmenting the adventure travel mar- ket with activities as the key variable. To explore the 48 adventure travel activities suggested by Sung et al. (1997), this study first examined these activities as to the appropriateness of their inclusion in the adventure travel category. Given the vast range of activities, it was expected that there would be significant differences among individual activities in terms of their de- grees of association with adventure travel.  This study also explored whether adventure travel activities could be grouped due to certain relationships among activities, that is there would be certain activity sets. Further, it was expected that these different activity sets could represent different market segments. As Loverseed (1997) suggested, the profile of adventure travelers varies according to the activities pursued. Importantly, this analysis could provide a linkage between products (activi-TABLE 1.

ties, in this case) and segments of the market (Jeffrey & Xie, 1995). Thus, this study attempted to identify group characteristics of activity sets and then to explain the factors associated with these characteristics. To summarize, this study examined the following three research hypotheses:1. There is a specific group of activities that is associated with adventure travel.2. There are significant differences among individual activities, measured in terms of levels of agreement, as to their inclusion within the adven- ture travel concept.3. There are sub-groupings of activities or activity sets, which may have practical value for segmenting the adventure travel market from the in- dustry providers¡¦ perspective.RESEARCH METHODSResearch Procedure  The data were collected from February 15-18, 1996 at the International Adventure Travel and Outdoor Show at the Rosemont Convention Center in Rosemont, Illinois. Being one of the major trade shows of its kind in the world, it provided access to large numbers of a representative group of people within a confined location and given period of time. Since the activity seg- mentation in this study was a product-driven approach, the exhibitors of the show were considered the most appropriate sample population for this study. They were all actively involved in the adventure travel industry as providers, operators, or promoters of adventure travel products.  Each participant was individually interviewed by a researcher with a brief introduction about the purpose of this study and provided with an 8-page, self-administered questionnaire. Some 194 people, among 273 exhibitors, were interviewed and the questionnaires were collected at the show by fol- low-up visits. Those who were unable to complete the questionnaires at the show were provided with self-addressed, postage-paid envelopes for return mailing. A total of 178 completed questionnaires were collected, and the response rate was 91.8% based upon the 194 questionnaires distributed.Measures  This study examined the 48 most commonly provided adventure travel activities suggested by Sung et al. (1997) (Table 1). The exhibitors at the show provided all of these activities, to varying degrees. To examine differ-
ences among activities, a five-point scale of level of agreement (score 1 being ¡¥¡¥strongly agree¡¦¡¦ to 5 ¡¥¡¥strongly disagree¡¦¡¦) was used to determine the inclu- sion of each activity within the adventure travel concepts. Differences in mean scores reflected variations among activities in levels of agreements as to which activities belonged in adventure travel.  To investigate relationships among activities, a factor analysis using the varimax rotation method was employed to categorize the 48 activities into smaller groups sharing common factors (activity sets). The data used for the factor analysis were the agreement scores for the 48 activities rated on a 1 to 5 basis. In addition, demographic profiles were included as descriptive mea- sures for different categories of adventure travel organizations. To add ex- planatory power to the activity variables and to examine their application in the industry, an open-ended question asked about key products or specialties of adventure travel currently provided by responding organizations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The results of this study supported the inclusion of all 48 activities in adventure travel. Some activities were more strongly linked to adventure travel than others. Mountain climbing showed the highest (Mean = 1.3371) and hunting the lowest level of agreement (Mean = 3.1067; with a score of 1 being strongly agree vs. 5 being strongly disagree). Overall, kayaking (river, sea), canoeing (river, sea), and other climbing activities (rock, ice) in natural environments were strongly associated with adventure travel, while activities employing motorized equipment, such as motorcycling, snowmobiling, and four-wheel drive trips were less strongly associated with adventure travel. Table 2 provides the mean scores and standard deviations of the 48 activities in terms of levels of agreement with their inclusion in adventure travel.  The first step of the factor analysis was to determine the appropriate number of factors by looking at a scree plot showing the eigenvalues of all possible factors (SAS Institute, 1994; Vogt, 1993). Various statistical meth- ods (i.e., principal, rotation, varimax, or maximum likelihood) of factor anal- ysis were tested to examine several alternatives, and diagnostic procedures were then followed until the activities were clearly identified in groups with the greatest possible score of total variance explained.  The varimax rotation method maximizing the variances among factors appeared to be the most appropriate for this study and grouped the 48 adven- ture travel activities into six factors. All six groups or activity sets appeared to be distinctive from one another and provided a clear opportunity for interpretation. The factors were labeled as soft nature, risk equipped, question marks, hard challenge, rugged nature, and winter snow. Table 3 summarizes the results of the factor analysis with the eigenvalues for the six rotated factor

Activities in- cluded were hiking, nature trips, bird-watching, walking tours, bicycling, canoeing, mountain biking, backpacking, camping, horseback riding, and fishing. Also noticeable was that these activities might commonly require a moderate level of physical involvement by the participants. Clearly these are soft (less physically challenging or active) pursuits in Mother Nature. They were labeled as the soft nature activity set.  Activities in factor 2 appeared to have a certain level of risk associated with participation. These activities are offered only in specific environments such as the sky (paragliding, hang-gliding, soaring, skydiving, or balloon- ing), water (windsurfing, sailing), or cave (spelunking). In almost all cases, specialized equipment is necessary for participation. These are activities that need to be specially equipped and that offer a certain level of risk.

  The third group (factor 3) was labeled as the question marks since most of these activities were questionable in terms of their belonging to the adventure travel category. Examples were hunting (Mean = 3.1067), motorcycling (Mean = 3.0843), snowmobiling (Mean = 2.8764), and four-wheel drive trips (Mean = 2.7472). Only scuba diving had a relatively high mean score (1.6685) compared to the other activities in this group (see Tables 2 and 3).  The fourth group of activities (factor 4) is associated with a higher level of physical involvement and getting involved in them appears to be challenging. Often times participants in climbing (ice, rock, and mountain) and kayaking (both river and sea) need to be trained in order to participate in these hard (more physically challenging and active) types of pursuits. Unlike the second group of activities (risk equipped) that are primarily supported by equipment, the physical challenge in pursuing these hard activities is the key factor. This activity set was given the label of hard challenge.  Activities such as jungle exploring, safaris, trekking, and rafting (factor 5) are offered in natural environments but often require a more physical chal- lenging or rugged involvement of their participants than soft nature activities (i.e., hiking, nature trips, backpacking, and camping). Similarly, both arctic trips and snorkeling are environment-driven in a rugged nature setting. This activity set was therefore called rugged nature.  The last group (factor 6) included winter skiing activities (cross country/ Nordic, alpine/downhill) and snowshoeing, all of which can only be offered during the winter with reasonable amounts of snow. They were termed the winter snow activity set.  In a previous study, Sung et al. (1997) provided an analysis of a total of 518 multiple responses to the key products offered by adventure travel pro- viders. These products were divided into two categories: (a) products associ- ated with adventure travel activities (n = 385, 74.3%) and (b) services associ- ated with adventure travel specialties (n = 133, 25.7%). Among activity-based products, it was found that traditional outdoor adventure activities in natural environments such as rafting, kayaking, hiking, trekking, safaris, and canoeing were the most popular adventure travel activities (Table 4).  In this study, soft nature (88.8%) and rugged nature (52.2%) activities were the most frequently provided by respondents. The question mark activi- ties (12.4%) were the least popular, perhaps due to the doubts about their inclusion in adventure travel. Winter snow activities were offered by only 14.0% of the respondents mainly due to the seasonality (Figure 1).  Table 5 shows that in terms of the travel products provided, multi activity travel packages in exotic destinations had the greatest frequency. Almost one fourth (23.6%, 42) of the respondents offered these packages, with or without specific adventure travel activities. The popularity of these packages can be better explained by the primary trip motive (activity and/or destination) in
Hall and Weiler¡¦s (1992) segmentation theory (activity-driven or destination- driven). Other popular services included expertise leadership (11.2%) and customized trips for small groups (7.3%). Overall, the results clearly indi- cated the popularity of soft adventure activities in multi-activity packages.Tour operators and wholesalers who produced, organized, and operatedTABLE 4.

The second major business category (27.5%) was DMOs (destination mar- keting organizations) or NTOs (national tourism organizations), who are the promoters and marketers of adventure travel destinations at regional or na- tional levels. This may explain the fact that many adventure travel activities are pursued in relatively underdeveloped, remote natural environments where tourism is generally expected to play a vital role in generating great economic benefits for communities. The other survey participants represented various business categories in the adventure travel segment such as accommodation operators (7.9%), equipment manufacturers (7.3%), and guide services (5.6%) (Figure 2).RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS  The major purpose of this study was to provide a first-ever segmentation analysis of adventure travel with activities as the key variable. Forty-eight adventure travel activities identified by Sung et al. (1997) were included in the analysis. Adventure travel providers from the industry were asked to indicate their levels of agreement in placing each of the 48 activities within the adventure travel concept. The results verified the inclusion of all 48 activities within adventure travel, but there were significant variations in agreement levels among the individual activities. Therefore, the first and second hypotheses of there being a specific group of activities, with varying levels of agreement on their inclusion within adventure travel, were sup- ported. For example, climbing, kayaking, and canoeing in natural environ- ments were strongly associated as adventure travel activities, while hunting,
FIGURE 2. Business Categories of the Participants(N = 178 with 224 multiple responses)motorcycling, snowmobiling, and four-wheel drive trips were less strongly supported as belonging within adventure travel.  The third hypothesis concerned the identification of sub-groupings of adventure travel activities (activity sets) and was addressed through a vari- max rotation method of factor analysis. The hypothesis that there were dis- tinct sub-groupings of adventure travel activities was supported by the factor analysis. The 48 adventure travel activities were reduced into six distinctive factors or activity sets, labeled as soft nature, risk equipped, question marks, hard challenge, rugged nature, and winter snow.  This study also clearly reflected the strong current trend in the industry towards the increasing popularity of multi activity, soft adventure travel packages in nature-based environments. These findings further corroborate the work of other researchers, including the Travel Industry Association of America (1998) and Loverseed (1998), who have asserted that soft adventure travel enjoys the largest market share of adventure travel, and is likely to have an even greater market share dominance in the future.IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND MARKETING  The results of this study have important implications for both future re- search studies and adventure travel marketing. By providing an analysis of
adventure travel by activities, this study should contribute to future market- ing research as a stepping stone for others to link activities to marketable products (packages/tours) and then to adventure travelers. That is, the analy- sis of adventure travel activities in this study utilized a provider-and product- driven approach. There is a definite opportunity in the future for researchers to compare the results of these provider-based findings with similar results through consumer-based research analysis. When these two research per- spectives are combined, and the six factors or adventure travel activity sets are subject to further empirical testing, a solid adventure travel segmentation approach will have been created linking adventure travel product offerings, adventure travelers¡¦ interests and needs, and activities.  When combined with the growing amount of research data on adventure traveler characteristics, this segmentation of adventure travel by activities should help management gain insights as to how to develop and deliver adventure travel products to their targeted customers with even great effec- tiveness and more generally how to develop more effective marketing strate- gies. Research completed for the Canadian Tourism Commission (then Tour- ism Canada) in 1995 provided a demographic profile (age groupings, gender, travel party composition, etc.) by individual adventure travel activities. The research conducted by the Travel Industry Association of America in 1997 provides additional information on the demographic and travel characteristics of adventure travelers by type of activity. Although not proven by the current research, it is suggested that the activity sets (segments/factors) found in this study are associated with distinct groups of customers who have varying demographic and travel characteristics. Adventure travel marketers could use this knowledge to realize a more effective match between the adventure travel activities offered in tours and packages and their potential adventure travel clients.  Loverseed (1998) has argued that adventure travelers have different pat- terns of use of various information sources when making their travel deci- sions. For example, she suggested that adventure travelers prefer to do their own research before trips and make above average use of the Internet to gather information. They are also less likely to be swayed by the typical glossy vacation brochures that make extravagant promises about destinations and facilities, and are more likely to be influenced by the advice of friends and relatives. When added to the knowledge that adventure travelers tend to be somewhat more well-educated, younger, and more widely-traveled (Chon & Singh, 1995; Weiler & Hall, 1992; Morrison et al., 1996; Oden, 1995; Tour- ism Canada, 1995; Wight, 1996), this seems to suggest that information-rich media such as the World Wide Web, specialized guidebooks, videotapes/CDs and televised travel programs, and travel expositions/shows might be more successful in reaching these people. The activity-based segmentation of
adventure travel provided in this research study will assist adventure travel marketers to make the most effective use of these information-rich media by supplying a new organizational framework for information provision. For example, information presented on Web sites could be organized by activity set and important hyperlinks provided to related sites for each activity or activity set. Potential online customers could be allowed to pre-select or pre-assemble their trips using a more selective, tailored menu of activities supported by a database of packages/tours and destinations.  The major limitation of this study, as previously acknowledged, is that it has only given one perspective of adventure travel, that of the adventure travel provider. Further research of expanded types will be needed to more fully comprehend this rapidly growing travel market segment, especially studies of adventure travelers incorporating with the consumers¡¦ perspective.REFERENCESAndereck, K.
