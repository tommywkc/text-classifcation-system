A B S T R A C T  Through a survey method, this study compares the process of how travel decision makers (DMs) and non- decision makers (Non-DMs) are motivated to travel and how they develop destination loyalty in an adventure tourism setting. The term 'DMs' refers to those individuals who make travel choices  for a trip while 'Non-DMs' are those who take the trip but do not make the travel choices (e.g. family members). Data were collected from Japanese rafting tourists (N=597) in Niseko, a famous adventure sport destination. The results demonstrate that the tourism motivations of DMs and Non-DMs di?er, with DMs being more likely to pursue excitement compared to Non-DMs, who tend to be more motivated by family-related needs. The ?ndings also show that DMs' destination loyalty is predicted by rafting services and cultural aspects  of  the  destination.  However, tourist satisfaction failed to mediate the relationship between pull motivations and destination loyalty for the DM group. Furthermore, these destination attributes also predicted Non-DMs' destination loyalty indirectly through tourist satisfaction.  Destination  marketers in adventure tourism settings should understand  that the key to successful destination marketing isto develop destination loyalty among Non-DMs by satisfying their expected destination attributes while at the same time providing extraordinary experiences that exceed the expectations of the DM.

   Adventure tourism is a growing distinct niche  tourism  market that provides exciting guided commercial tours through an outdoor activity centered on the natural terrain of the destination (World Tourism Organization, 2014). The adventure tourism market is es- timated at approXimately US$263 billion and is expected to grow continuously worldwide (Adventure  Travel  Trade  Association, 2013). Among a wide variety of adventure tourism activities, white- water  rafting  has  been  regarded  as  a  distinctive  activity  that  cansatisfy tourists¡¦ needs by providing extraordinary and thrilling ex- periences (Arnould & Price, 1993; Fluker & Turner, 2000; Wu &Liang, 2011). Currently, white-water rafting is utilized globally to attract adventure tourists to a wide variety of destinations such as the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Japan Rafting Association, 2014). In Japan, tourism is considered a vital industry to the country's economy and due to the strategic e?orts of the Japanese government, the popularity of tourism in Japan is at all-time high (Japan Association of Travel Agents, 2014). For example, the number of tourists who visit a popular adventure tourism destination, Niseko,
reached an record high of approXimately 1.7 million visitors in 2015 (Niseko Town, 2015).   However, destination marketing has become increasingly com- petitive due to market saturation (Battour, Battor, & Ismail, 2012; Park & Jang, 2013). Tourists are now able to choose between nu- merous destinations for their vacation (Oppewal, Huybers, & Crouch, 2015). Thus, destination marketers must understand what motivates and attracts tourists to visit certain destinations and how to satisfy these needs to develop e?ective destination marketing strategies (Battour et al., 2012; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). In this respect, fostering destination loyalty is an essential element to survive in the saturated tourism market as tourists that are loyal to a destination are more likely to revisit and recommend the destination to others (Chen & Xiao, 2013; Meleddu, Paci, & Pulina, 2015). Although loyal tourists tend to spend less money than ?rst-timers (Petrick, 2004a), their spending will at least provide positive economic impact to the des- tination, and their word-of-month will encourage other ?rst-timers to visit the destination.

   EXtensive research has been conducted to understand destination loyalty (e.g. Chi & Qu, 2008; Liu, Lin, & Wang, 2012). Speci?cally, research has focused on the interplay between push and pull motiva- tions and satisfaction (Battour et al., 2012; Fluker & Turner, 2000). However, research into the di?erences between travel decision makers (DMs) and non-decision makers (Non-DMs) remains scarce. This issue is particularly important for adventure tourism destination managers as adventure tourists commonly travel with friends and family members (Adventure Travel Trade Association, 2013). 'DMs' refers to the in- dividuals who make travel choices for a trip, while 'Non-DMs' are those who do not, such as family members on a parent-led trip (Gilbert & Wong, 2003). DMs and Non-DMs are essentially di?erent in terms of their perceptions, expectations, and behavioral patterns (Kim, Choi, Agrusa, Wang, & Kim, 2010; Wang, Hsieh, Yeh, & Tsai, 2004). From theadventure tourism manager¡¦s point of view, understanding how thesedistinct tourist segments develop motivation, satisfaction, and desti- nation loyalty can provide useful insights for developing e?ective destination marketing strategies. Therefore, the purposes of the current study were to: (1) test the relationship between tourism motivations, satisfaction, and destination loyalty for adventure tourists and (2) ex- plore how these constructs di?er between DMs and Non-DMs (see Fig. 1).1. Literature review1.1. Push/pull motivations   Motivation has played a central role in understanding travel beha- vior and decision making. While prominent sociological explanations have been suggested to explain travel behavior, such as the push away from the societal disintegration (Dann, 1977) or the search for ex- istential meaning lost in modern life (Cohen, 1979), psychological needs have generally been recognized as motivational factors for travel (Baloglu & Uysal, 1996; Fluker & Turner, 2000; Moscardo, Dann, & McKercher, 2014; Walters, Mair, & Ritchie, 2015). A common con- ceptualization of tourist motivation is based on the internal and ex- ternal motives of tourists, described as 'push' and 'pull' respectively (Crompton, 1979; Uysal, Li, & Sirakaya-Turk, 2008; Wu & Wall, 2016; Youse? & Marzuki, 2015).   The push and pull framework is a frequently used method to explain tourist behavior (Chen & Chen, 2015) and tourism motivation (Fluker & Turner, 2000; Prayag & Hosany, 2014; Uysal & Jurowski, 1994). Ac- cordingly, 'push motivation' refers to the inner force within the traveler that leads to the decision to undertake a journey (i.e. psychological needs to travel outside of everyday life). 'Pull motivation' refers to an external force, such as the attributes of a destination that lead the traveler to select one destination over another once the decision to travel is made. Tourist motivation is explained by the push and pull framework in that people travel because they are pushed by internalFig. 1. Conceptual model.
forces and then pulled by the external forces of a tourist destination (Cha, McCleary, & Uysal, 1995; Uysal et al., 2008).   Push factors are derived from socio-psychological motives that drive individuals to travel (Baloglu & Uysal, 1996; Crompton, 1979; Prayag & Hosany, 2014; Uysal et al., 2008). For example, psychological factors such as escaping, relaxation, relation, knowledge, self-esteem, family togetherness, and entertainment are considered push factors (Buckley, McDonald, Duan, Sun, & Chen, 2014; Crompton, 1979; Fluker & Turner, 2000; Klenosky, 2002). On the other hand, pull factors are related to features and attributes of destinations such as weather, scenery, at- tractions, physical amenities, airfare, history and culture (Dann, 1997; Fluker & Turner, 2000; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Buckley et al. (2014) conducted a study in a Chinese white-water rafting context and found that Chinese white-water rafting travelers possessed common push and pull motivations such as relax, escape, nature, and culture. Regarding the relationship between push and pull motivations, push factors are considered to precede pull factors because pull factors only come into consideration once the decision to travel has been made as where to go, what to see and do in the chosen destination (Kim, Lee, & Klenosky, 2003; Zoltan & Masiero, 2012). Klenosky (2002) o?ers a similar ex-planation by summarizing the push factor with the question ¡¥whether togo¡¦ and the pull factor as ¡¥where to go.¡¦ Thus, the following hypothesis was posited:H1. : Push motivations will positively in?uence pull motivations.1.2. Relationships among motivation, satisfaction, and destination loyalty   In addition to push/pull motivations, another factor critical to successful destination marketing is tourist satisfaction (Meng, Tepanon, & Uysal, 2008; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Tourist satisfaction has been ex- amined as it relates to a variety of variables such as place attachment (Yuksel, Yuksel, & Bilim, 2010) and destination image (Kaplanidou & Vogt, 2007). As an important determinant of tourist behavior (e.g. re- peat visitation, intention to recommend), satisfaction requires further scholarly attention to better understand its explanatory power and in- terrelationships with other signi?cant factors for destination marketing. The e?ect of motivation on satisfaction has been examined in the ?eld of leisure and tourism extensively (Noe & Uysal, 1997; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Speci?cally, tourist satisfaction is described as how well a destination ful?lled a tourist's speci?c needs (Meng et al., 2008), and motivation has been acknowledged as one of the antecedents to sa- tisfaction (Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Yoon and Uysal (2005) revealed that pull motives are tourism attractions, and Noe and Uysal (1997) argue satisfaction is an outcome elicited from the consumer evaluation of destination performance. Previous literature is consistent in the idea that tourist attractions can produce tourist satisfaction (Jurowski, Cumbow, Uysal, & Noe, 1995). Therefore, it could be reasoned thatsatisfaction is associated with tourists¡¦ motivations related to the spe-ci?c attributes of a destination. Therefore, we developed the following hypothesis:H2. : Pull motivations will positively in?uence satisfaction.   Motivation and satisfaction have been demonstrated to collectively in?uence destination loyalty (Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Destination loyalty in general refers to the idea that tourists form positive attitudes towards a destination that leads to repeat visitation and positive word-of-mouth (Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Considering the destination as a product to be branded and consumed (Hultman & Hall, 2012), destination loyalty in tourism studies is equivalent to customer loyalty from brand equity in marketing studies (Boo, Busser, & Baloglu, 2009; Pike, Bianchi, Kerr, & Patti, 2010). Customer loyalty toward a product or brand is generally conceptualized as behavioral (Ehrenberg, Goodhardt, & Barwise, 1990; Kahn, Kalwani, & Morrison, 1986) and attitudinal (Baldinger & Rubinson, 1996). Behavioral loyalty refers to repeat purchasing while attitudinal loyalty refers to the preference and

favorable attitude of the consumer towards the product or brand. Scholars have advocated for the need to consider attitudinal loyalty as customer loyalty (Baldinger & Rubinson, 1996) and Konecnik and Gartner (2007) found that both forms of loyalty can be used as an in- dicator of brand loyalty in determining destination choice.   The concept of destination loyalty has been operationalized as preference to visit (Boo et al., 2009; Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Pike et al., 2010), intention to recommend (Boo et al., 2009; Chi & Qu, 2008; Konecnik & Gartner, 2007), intention to visit (Chi & Qu, 2008; Konecnik & Gartner, 2007), and perceived bene?t (Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Pike et al., 2010). While there is no consensus among scholars, destination loyalty typically is examined as a miXture of repeat visita- tion and intention to recommend a destination (Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). In previous tourism literature, repeated visitation and recommendation were examined as outcome variables of motivations and satisfaction (Kozak, 2001; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Thus, destination loyalty is proposed to be associated with destination attri- butes (i.e. pull motivation).H3. : Pull motivations will positively in?uence destination loyalty.   Previous studies have also acknowledged that satis?ed visitors tend to revisit and recommend a destination (Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). While satisfaction is considered to be an ante- cedent of destination loyalty (Chi & Qu, 2008), it is noteworthy that the role of satisfaction as an outcome of motivation and a mediator in the relationship between motivation and destination loyalty. Hence, the following hypothesis was proposed:H4. : Pull motivation will positively in?uence destination loyalty through satisfaction.1.3. Di?erences between travel DM and Non-DM   This study examines the moderating role of travel DMs and Non- DMs in a proposed model. DMs refer to the individuals who make travel choices for a trip, while Non-DMs are those who do not make such choices (Gilbert & Wong, 2003). Understanding the di?erences between DMs and Non-DMs is an important step in obtaining a comparative advantage in tourism and destination management. This is especially important for adventure tourism managers, as adventure tourists tend to travel with friends and family members (Adventure Travel Trade Association, 2013). Furthermore, di?erentiating between DMs and Non-DMs enables destination managers to develop e?ective promotion strategies that appeal to both groups (Kim et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2004). However, the di?erences between DMs and Non-DMs have not been thoroughly examined especially in the context of adventure tourism. Previous work has found that push and pull motives di?er among socio-demographic groups (Kim et al., 2003; Loker-Murphy, 1997). For example, Kim et al. (2003) found that push and pull factors di?er by gender and income among Korean national park visitors.Research has also demonstrated numerous di?erences between DMsand Non-DMs exist. For example, O¡¦Reilly (1982) found that DMs and Non-DMs utilize di?erent information sources, as DMs rely heavily on trustworthy information sources and value information generated byoral communications in groups to which they belong. DMs have also been found to pay closer attention to speci?c product attributes (Boland, Brucks, & Nielsen, 2012). Within the context of family trips, Kim et al. (2010) discovered that husbands typically made decisions regarding transportation, while wives made decisions regarding din- ning and the initial choice to travel and subsequent revisit decisions. Children have also been found to directly and indirectly impact the decision-making process related to family trips (Gram, 2007). Similarly, di?erences regarding push and pull factors have also been found in regards to nationality and marital status, as evidenced by a study conducted by Chen and Chen (2015) on international birdwatchers. Prebensen and Kleiven (2006) examined the di?erences between travel
DMs and Non-DMs in the context of Norwegian charter-?ight tourists, which revealed that DMs had stronger motivations for the type of trip (i.e. sun/beach or other). Even so, the authors acknowledged that 'some evidence of stronger relationships with decision makers exists, but that it is not totally convincing¡¦ as they acknowledged ¡¥the study's opera-tional de?nition of ¡§non-deciders¡¨ is not very clear¡¦ (p. 93). In thecontext of active event travel, Buning and Gibson (2016) found that preferences for events, destinations, and style of travel change whether or not non-participants (i.e. spouse, children) are included. These em- pirical ?ndings imply that DMs are more involved, have varying mo- tives and preferences, and are deliberate in their product choices and possess higher expectation regarding target products than Non-DMs. Therefore, the following hypothesis was advanced:H5. : The structural coe?cients in the proposed conceptual model will di?er between DMs and Non-DMs.2. Method2.1. Study setting and data collection   Data were collected using a paper-and-pencil survey of Japanese adventure tourists participating in a white-water rafting tour in Niseko, a famous Japanese outdoor sporting resort. A white-water rafting company, Niseko Adventure Center (NAC), based in Niseko, served as the data-collection site. NAC is the oldest white-water rafting company in the area and attracts tourists from the around the world. NAC op- erates on the Shiribetsu River and o?ers a wide variety of rafting tours focused on tourists who possess little to no prior experience. The rafting trips are led by a certi?ed rafting guide and are approXimately three hours in duration. Customers of the NAC typically wait at a patio lounge before and after their rafting trip while completing registration and insurance paperwork. The survey was administered at this location as the customers returned from the rafting trips. The data collection was implemented for a two-week period in August of 2007. Participants were approached by trained examiners and a total of 735 ques- tionnaires were distributed. After removing incomplete cases the total sample comprised N=597 responses. The sample consisted of 327 male participants (54.8%) and 270 females (45.2%). The majority of parti- cipants were relatively young, as 54.8% were between 18 and 29 yearsold and 20.1% were 30 ¡V 39 years old. With regard to occupation, morethan half of the sample was employed full-time (55.9%) followed by students (18.1%), self-employed (11.1%), home workers (3.7%), andpart-time employees (3.2%).2.2. Instrumentation   The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: push and pull motivations; satisfaction; destination loyalty; and demographic in- formation. Push and pull motivations were measured with ques- tionnaire items validated in previous literature (Cha et al., 1995; Crompton, 1979; Wu & Liang, 2011; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). In addition, since previous literature demonstrated that motivation varies based on the destination (Devesa, Laguna, & Palacios, 2010) and no established scales measure Japanese domestic tourism motivation existed, a pre- test was conducted to identify items that previous scales may have failed to capture. The pre-test was administrated at the same location as the main data collection and a total of 119 individuals who participated in white-water rafting trips were surveyed. The pre-test asked re- spondents to openly write down their motivations to visit the Niseko area. Based on previously developed items and the pre-test, 30 push and 31 pull motivational items were identi?ed. These items were further discussed by the researchers and two industry experts. In this process, face validity of the individual items was assessed and several items were combined or eliminated. As a result, 15 items for push motivation and 13 items for pull motivation were included in the study. All

motivation items were measured on a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 7 (very important).   Satisfaction was measured with three items adopted from previous literature (Lee, Yoon, & Lee, 2007; Valle, Silva, Mendes, & Guerreiro, 2006; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Actual items were (1) ¡¥Overall, how sa-tis?ed were you with your holiday in Niseko? ¡¦ (2) ¡¥How would you rateNiseko compared to other similar places you may have visited? ¡¦, and(3) ¡¥How would you rate Niseko compared to what you expected? ¡¦. Thesatisfaction items were measured on a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all satis?ed) to 7 (very satis?ed) for the ?rst item, 1 (much worse) to 7 (much better) for the second item, and 1 (much worse than I expected) to 7 (much better than I expected).   Destination loyalty was measured with two items adopted from existing loyalty literature (Konecnik & Gartner, 2007; Yoon & Uysal, 2005). Actual items were (1) ¡¥Will you suggest Niseko to your friends/relatives to visit?¡¦ and (2) ¡¥In the next two years, how likely is that youwill take another visit to Niseko? ¡¦. These items were also measured on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not likely) to 7 (de?nitely). Thequestionnaire was originally written in English and was translated into Japanese by following a rigorous back-translation method (Hui & Triandis, 1985).   Evidence suggests that socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and roles in family (e.g. husband, wife, children) can be useful variables to identify travel DMs (Wang et al., 2004). However, this approach has also been criticized because of its complexity (Kim et al., 2010). In the ?elds of consumer research as well as tourism, a single-item measurement is typically utilized to distinguish DMs and Non-DMs (Gilbert & Wong, 2003). Therefore, a single item measure was adopted and participants were asked to indicate whether they took the decision- making role for Niseko trip (i.e. yes or no). Based on the re- sponse, participants who answered (or did not answer) a?rmatively to the above question were assigned to the DM (or Non-DM) group. Identifying the population size for DM and Non-DM groups was chal- lenging due to the data availability. Hence, the plan was to collect at least 100 responses for both DM and Non-DM groups in order to minimize biased estimates (Anderson & Gerbing, 1984). The resulting subsamples consisted of DMs (n=265) and Non-DMs (n=332). Lastly, the questionnaire asked participants how they procure general tourism information for vacation travel.2.3. Data analysis   Data analysis consisted of four main steps and was executed via IBM SPSS and AMOS statistics software. First, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to reveal the underlying factor structure of the push and pull motivations. Second, the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement model incorporating push and pull moti- vations, tourist satisfaction, and destination loyalty were then assessed using a con?rmatory factor (CFA) analysis paired with calculating ?t indices, average variance extracted (AVE), and squared inter-correla- tions. Third, measurement invariance between DM and Non-DM groups was tested to ensure the same constructs were measured across the two groups. Lastly, multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted using maximum likelihood estimation to examine the dif- ferences between DMs and Non-DMs within the proposed model. Lastly, chi-square di?erence testing was used to assess variation in general tourism information between the DM and Non-DM groups.3. Results3.1. Exploratory factor analysis   EFA with orthogonal varimax rotation was ?rst run to identify the dimensions of the push and pull motivations. Based on the established guideline recommended by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994), four items with factor loadings below .40 were removed. The EFA results
suggested that 'push motivation' comprised four factors and 'pull mo- tivation' comprised three factors. The identi?ed constructs of push motivation were named 'social', 'escape', 'family', and 'excitement', whereas the pull motivation factors were named 'natural resources', 'culture', and 'rafting services'. These factors were deemed consistent with previously identi?ed tourism motivational constructs (e.g. Cater, 2006; Cha et al., 1995; Kim et al., 2003; Yoon & Uysal, 2005).3.2. Measurement model   The CFA results revealed that the measurement model acceptably ?t the    data    (£q2=945.38,    df=341,    £q2/df=2.77;    GFI=.90;    AGFI=.88;RMSEA=.05; CFI=.91). The convergent validity of the scales was as-sessed by calculating AVE for each construct. The results revealed that the AVE scores of all the factors were greater than commonly agreed criterion of .50 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Finally, discriminant validity was assessed by comparing the AVE and squared inter-correlations of each factor. The AVE scores were indeed greater than the squared inter- correlations hence, support for discriminant validity was also present (Fornell & Lacker, 1981). The internal consistency of each construct was also evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha coe?cients. The coe?cients of each construct ranged from .74 to .90, which provided support that the internal consistency of the scales was adequate (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). The complete CFA results are provided in Tables 1 and 2.3.3. Measurement invariance   Invariance testing was conducted to evaluate whether the mea- surement model is statistically invariant between DMs and Non-DMs. Following the established method recommended by Chen (2007) and Netemeyer, Bearden, and Sharma (2003), the nested multiple-group structural equation models were analyzed. First, the results of the in-variance test indicated that the con?gural model adequately ?t the data (£q2/df=1476.20/716=2.06, CFI=.89, RMSEA=.04). Factor  loadings were then constrained to be equal between DM and Non-DM groups to create the nested model within the con?gural model. The chi-square di?erence indicated that the con?gural model and nested model were statistically  di?erent,  £q2£G(£Gdf=20)  =31.18,  p < .05.  However,  thisindicator is greatly in?uenced by the sample size (Chen, 2007). Theresults indicated that there was no substantial di?erence in CFI (.002) and RMSEA (less than .001). Following Chen's (2007) guideline (i.e. £GCFI?.005 and £GRESEA?.010), the results indicated the measurementmodel   was   invariant   between   groups.   Afterwards,   constraints   onstructure coe?cients to assess the structural invariance were added. The results revealed that the di?erence in the chi-square statistic was signi?cant,   £q2£G(£Gdf=39)=75.80,   p < .01,   which   provided   supportthat structural coe?cients of two groups are di?erent within the pro-posed model.3.4. Multi-group structural equation model   The results of multi-group SEM are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2. With regard to the relationship between push and pull motiva- tions, the results of multi-group structural equation model indicated that a majority of push motivations signi?cantly predicts pull motiva- tions. Speci?cally, regardless of travel DM status, two push motivationfactors (i.e. social and escape) consistently in?uenced destination at- tributes (social to culture, £]DM=.69, £]Non-DM=.50; social to natural resources, £]DM=.32, £]Non-DM=.19; social to rafting services, £]DM=.20, £]Non-DM=.18;  escape  to  culture,  £]DM=.25,  £]Non- DM=.14;  escape  to  natural  resources,  £]DM=.50,  £]Non-DM=.35;  es-cape to rafting services, £]DM=.30, £]Non-DM=.25). When comparingtravel DMs and Non-DMs, signi?cant di?erences emerged in the relationships between family and culture (£]DM=.08 vs. £]Non- DM=.23) as well as excitement and natural resources (£]DM=.15 vs.

Although  family  and  excitement  for  Non-DM  group did not play a signi?cant role in predicting natural environment, the ?ndings provide adequate support for H1.   Regarding the relationship between pull motivations and destina- tion loyalty, the results demonstrated that only two pull motivations for the DM group signi?cantly predicted destination loyalty (i.e. cul- ture and rafting services). Speci?cally, the results indicated that cul- ture  (£]DM=.12,  p < .05)  and  rafting  services  (£]DM=.18,  p < .01)were signi?cantly associated with DM's destination loyalty, whereasthese signi?cant in?uences were not observed for the Non-DM group,           	
providing evidence that H3 was only partially supported for the DM group.   The Sobel test revealed signi?cant indirect e?ects from pull mo- tivations to destination loyalty through tourism satisfaction. For the DM group, the results indicated that the indirect e?ect of rafting services to destination loyalty through tourism satisfaction was sig- ni?cant  (Z=2.96,  £]=.10,  p < .01).  However,  the  indirect  e?ect  wasweaker than the direct e?ect of rafting services to destination loyalty(£]=.21, p < .01), which suggests that the mediation e?ect of tourism satisfaction  was  not  upheld.  For  the  Non-DM  group,  although  thedirect e?ects of pull motivations to destination loyalty were not signi?cant, satisfaction played a signi?cant mediating role in the relationship between culture and destination loyalty (Z=4.38, £]=.09,  p < .01)  as  well  as  rafting  services  and  destination  loyalty

Other information channels (e.g. the Internet and newspaper) were not found di?er between DMs and Non-DMs.4.  Discussion   Despite the growing interest in adventure tourism from both practitioners and scholars, the majority of research has focused on North American, European, and Oceanian countries. Moreover, rafting tourism has received surprisingly limited attention from destination marketing perspectives. Proper understanding of the motivational factors of tourists is critical to surviving in this competitive market, as these motives are positively associated with satisfaction and destina- tion loyalty (Battour et al., 2012). The current study was conducted to answer these questions and to further investigate the di?erences re- garding the processes of developing destination loyalty between two di?erent important tourist segments: travel DMs and Non-DMs in Japan.   The results demonstrate that social and escape related desires (i.e. push motivations) are associated with all of the destination attributes (i.e. pull motivations) in both DM and Non-DM groups. These ?ndings are in accordance with the previous tourism literature indicating that desires to socialize and escape from daily life are particularly important push motivations (e.g. Buckley et al., 2014; Fluker & Turner, 2000; Park & Yoon, 2009). Marketing managers should continue to emphasize that the destination can satisfy these needs by providing opportunities to socialize and extraordinary experiences through rafting (Arnould & Price, 1993; Fluker & Turner, 2000). Overall, factors encouraging travel DMs and Non-DMs are similar except for two motivational factors: ex- citement and family.   The ?ndings indicate that DMs are more motivated to pursue ex- citement, which in?uences their adventure tourism choices based on attraction (i.e. natural resources). Non-DMs, in contrast, tend to focus more on the cultural aspects of a destination when they are motivated to travel for family-related reasons. As excitement is a crucial element in adventure tourism (Cater, 2006), DMs are deemed to be attracted by this core value. Indeed, it is in line with previous literature, which holds
that travel DMs are more goal-oriented than Non-DMs (Prebensen & Kleiven, 2006). Hence, the speci?c link between excitement and at- traction should be strongly associated for DMs. Along with emphasizing social and escape aspects, destination marketing managers should also highlight that rich natural resources can provide exciting experiences especially for DMs. This promotional strategy can be particularly ef- fective when it is advertised in tourism-related magazines as indicated by the tourism information search channels used by DMs. Non-DMs are more likely to be encouraged to travel by family-related desires. This ?nding can be interpreted in two ways. First, Non-DMs are not highly involved in white-water rafting and are attracted by peripheral service elements (Petty, Cacioppo, & Schumann, 1983). Perhaps, however, DMs are highly involved in the activity and Non-DMs are simply following along as travel companions. Indeed, Buning and Gibson (2016) argue that travel behavior and motivation change as event participants in- clude a non-participant (e.g. spouse, children) in their travel behavior. The authors explain that although the emphasis for the participant is the event and the related activity, the non-participant is driven to travel to support the participant's desires.The pull motivations regarding culture and natural resources werenot associated with satisfaction for the DM group. This can be inter- preted in line with the expectancy-con?rmation paradigm, which denotes that satisfaction is determined by the level of expectation and actual experience (Oliver & Westbrook, 1993). DMs might have possessed higher expectations toward the destination because they searched for more information than Non-DMs prior to the trip. Nevertheless, the reason why DM satisfaction was still associated with rafting services can be related to the extraordinary nature of white- water rafting experiences (Arnould & Price, 1993). When DMs con- sume the rafting package tour, the amalgamation of river, hot spring, and rafting- related services provide experiences that can exceed their expectations. For the Non-DM group, along with rafting experiences, culture also predicted tourism satisfaction. Thus, Non-DMs poten- tially have lower expectations that might be more easily satis?ed. Meanwhile, this implies that destination managers face a situation where they must satisfy demanding DMs and need to develop a fur- ther understanding of whether a satis?ed Non-DM becomes a DM in the future.

   The current study also examined the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationship between pull motivations and destination loyalty. Although the results of the Sobel test demonstrated that destination loyalty of DMs was enhanced when they are satis?ed with rafting ser- vices, the direct e?ects of rafting services on destination loyalty was stronger than the indirect e?ect through satisfaction. The ?ndings imply that DMs might have already developed destination loyalty due to culture and rafting-related destination attributes. In contrast, the destination loyalty of Non-DMs was not associated with any of the destination attributes but was indirectly in?uenced through tourismsatisfaction. Therefore, Non-DMs¡¦ destination loyalty can be enhanced when their pull motivation regarding culture as well as rafting servicesare satis?ed. In conclusion, while retaining loyal DMs is crucial, mar- keting managers should also focus on turning Non-DMs into loyal tourists by improving the cultural elements and rafting services of the destination. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated that previous travel experiences signi?cantly in?uence tourist behaviors (Fluker & Turner, 2000; Kaplanidou & Vogt, 2007). Since Non-DMs may possess lower expectations compared to DMs, this strategy can be challenging but rewarding as they will likely revisit and recommend the destination to other potential tourists. Furthermore, although it is a speculative view, Non-DMs who are satis?ed with the destination experiences may eventually become DMs in the future trips.Despite the advances presented here, there are limitations that ne-cessitate acknowledgement and provide opportunities for future re- search. Firstly, the authors were unable to account for the e?ects of other potential variables such as destination image (Kaplanidou & Vogt, 2007) and perceived value (Petrick, 2004b) due to the resources available and the length of the questionnaire. Moving forward, future research should examine whether the aforementioned variables play intervening roles in the relationship between tourist motivations, sa- tisfaction, and destination loyalty. Secondly, future research should be conducted with more rigorous data collection. Although scholars are not always able to implement the ideal data-collection methods, the cross-sectional data utilized in this study could be limited in its ability to reveal causalities among variables. Furthermore, although the cur- rent study was able to reveal some di?erences between DMs and Non- DMs, the context of this study was limited to the customers of one Ja- panese adventure tourism company. In fact, Buckley et al. (2014) conducted a study focusing on Chinese water-rafting customers andfound that water-rafting customers¡¦ expectations di?er by culture asadventure activities are delivered di?erently in each country. Re- searchers should exercise caution regarding the generalizability of the results to other contexts. Meanwhile, Buckley et al. (2014) calls for cross-cultural comparisons to further understand how DMs and Non- DMs in di?erent adventure tourism contexts develop their destination loyalty. An approach using this method would provide a better un- derstanding of the di?erences between these two important tourist segments and enable successful destination management. Sustainability is another factor that can further enhance the quality of destination management especially in communities that utilize resource-based tourism (Tirasatayapitak, Chaiyasain, & Beeton, 2015). Although the focus of the current study was on motivation, satisfaction, and desti- nation loyalty for adventure tourists, holistic approaches incorporating social and environmental aspects of destination management will be needed in future research.ReferencesAdventure Travel Trade Association.
