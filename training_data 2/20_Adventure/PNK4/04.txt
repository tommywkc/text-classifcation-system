ABSTRACTTravellers are now journeying to the frontiers of our world, including the poles, deserts, mountain peaks, the depths of the ocean and even outer space. These extraordinary travel experiences are often carried out in the ¡¥footsteps¡¦ of explorers or adventurers, both past and present, and may be motivated or influenced by fantasy narratives and dreamscapes. This paper uses narrative analysis to examine some of the metaphors and imagery used by these individuals when describing these journeys, including mythic, imaginary and theatrical elements, and explores the common discourse of the adventure myth and the metempsychotic journey.

Recent research has focused*Correspondence to: J. Laing, PO Box 1071, Narre Warren, Victoria 3805, Australia.E-mail: jennifer.laing@buseco.monash.edu.au
on travel experiences in the most remote and unique locations on Earth, such as deserts, mountains, the poles or outer space, where individuals are challenged, both physically and psychologically, by ¡¥life on the edge¡¦ (Cohen, 2004; Laing and Crouch, 2005). These frontier travellers journey largely without established tourist infrastructure in place, gen- erally carry their own food, shelter and provi- sions, and must undergo extensive training beforehand to survive the rigours of the journey. These experiences are high cost and high risk and attract considerable public and consequently media interest because they are still relatively rare. Frontier journeys, with all their visceral delights as well as dangers, appear to be motivated or influenced by fanta- sies and myths, as well as long-held and deeply felt desires, as the traveller moves into unknown territories and situations. Adventure tourism experiences, even those at the very high or ¡¥hard¡¦ end, are undertaken ¡¥within a frame- work of myth and dramatic story line¡¦ (Trauer, 2006, p. 185). The myths and narratives associ- ated with frontier travel may therefore help us to understand the ¡¥mythology of adventure¡¦ (Cater, 2006, p. 322) more broadly, as well as current trends in tourism.A qualitative study of frontier travellers,predominantly from Australia, the UK and the USA, has been conducted to explore their con- ceptualisation of their own travel experiences based on adventure mythology. This paper will consider some of the metaphors and imagery used by frontier travellers when describing their travel experiences and exam- ines whether there are shared narratives or a common discourse expressed across the differ- ent journeys. This paper begins with a consid- eration of the literature on fantasy and mythicalCopyright ý 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

narratives behind travel, particularly focusing on the frontier or adventure experience.LITERATURE REVIEWIt has been suggested that individuals organise and interpret their experiences, including tourism, through mythologies (Shields, 1991; Johns and Clarke, 2001; Shackley, 2001; Johns and Gyim?thy, 2002; Hennig, 2002), and myth may be an important part of the appeal of tourism destinations (Butler, 1990; Riley, 1994), as well as motivations to travel. Myth has been defined both in the sense of a narrative that is ¡¥believed to be true by the people who tell it¡¦ (Hunter and Whitten, 1976, p. 279) and as a linguistic construct (Barthes, 1973; Johns and Clarke, 2001; Johns and Gyim?thy, 2002), where words can be associated with deeper and sometimes hidden meanings. Myths can also be viewed as collective expressions or rep- resentations of cultural beliefs and values, a form of ¡¥cultural consensus¡¦ (Johns and Clarke, 2001, p. 336) that can help to shape personal or national identity (Palmer, 1999). Hennig (2002) takes the view that tourism or travel straddles both the mythical and the physical world ¡X tied to the former while taking place in the latter¡X and includes the frontier as a modern myth.This allows for the ritual re-enactment of these myths, often in the form of ¡¥heroic journeys¡¦ or experiences. Hutt (1996, p. 49) also links myth to representations in the media and ¡¥popular literature¡¦, particularly with reference to ¡¥far- flung corners of the world¡¦. Texts such as Henry Morton Stanley¡¦s Through the Dark Con- tinent (1878) or Shackleton¡¦s South (1919) have ¡¥set the imaginative pathways¡¦ (Zurick, 1995) for modern travellers. Bishop (1989, p. 3) observes that these travel narratives ¡¥are an important aspect of a culture¡¦s myth-making¡¦. The frontier traveller is often recreating or retracing the expeditions of early explorers or travellers in remote and inaccessible places, and may be inspired by reading past accounts of exotic and dangerous landscapes, fuelling childhood fantasies that persist in adulthood. Seaton (2002, p. 155) calls these texts, and the type of travel they are based on, ¡¥metempsy- chotic¡¦, where ¡¥the tourist takes on the persona of a significant other or group, as a role model
for a particular repeated journey¡¦. Many fron- tier travellers later write their own modern tales of adventure based on their journeys, which may serve as inspiration for a new gen- eration of travellers. These past and present tales may also help to shape the personal nar- rative of the traveller, in the sense of ¡¥sets of stories which unfold as life proceeds¡¦ (Voase, 2007, p. 49). The traveller makes reference to these narratives, consciously or subconsciously, in making sense of an experience or encounter (Voase, 2007).  Mythical narratives forming part of the fron- tier travel experience might therefore be based on links between these experiences and explo- ration or the heroic journey. The exploration myth is founded in what Goetzmann (1979) called the First Great Age of Discovery by Spain and Portugal in the 16th century, continuing in the second wave characterised by the great sea voyages of the 18th and 19th centuries ¡X chiefly by the British and French ¡X and on to the Third Age of explora- tion (Pyne, 1987, 2004; Sagan and Pyne, 1988; Pyne, 1993), covering the ocean depths, the icy landscapes of Antarctica and outer space. Many of the myths surrounding explorers have been perpetuated and embellished in literature (Haynes, 1998; Collis, 2000). The heroic journey, on the other hand, is associated with classical myths, such as Homer¡¦s Odyssey or Jason¡¦s search for the Golden Fleece, which involve the hero leaving their homeland for unknown hardships and trials and later returning, renewed and changed by the experience. ¡¥To look death in the face and to return to the living is the ultimate proof of a hero¡¦s extraordinary stature¡¦ (Van Nortwick, 1992, p. 28). Both are part of the Western cultural legacy, although it might be argued that they are a more funda- mental heritage of all human beings. As Allen (2002, p. xi) notes, ¡¥We are all explorers. Our desire to discover, and then share that new- found knowledge, is part of what makes us human ¡X indeed, has played an important part in our success as a species¡¦.This paper focuses on the use of mythic andfantastical metaphors and imagery associated with frontier journeys. The next section looks at the methods used in this study and provides definitions of some of the key concepts dis- cussed in this paper.

Metaphors and Imagery behind Travel Experiences	129
METHODSTranscripts of long interviews with 37 frontier travellers, together with 50 texts written by frontier travellers (mainly books and several Internet diaries) were analysed for their use of metaphors and imagery associated with fantasy, myth and dreams. Setting up inter- views with these individuals mostly involved contact by email through their own websites, as many of these travellers attract media atten- tion and are required to self-promote as a condition of sponsorship (Laing and Crouch, 2005). In a few instances in the latter part of the study, snowball sampling was used, where some individuals recommended approaching other frontier travellers for participation in an interview. Only limited use was made of this approach in the interest of accessing as diverse and representative a group as possible (Taylor and Bogdan, 1998; Seale, 1999).The choice of qualitative research and aninterpretivist approach in this study was made in order to allow the participants¡¦ voices to be heard, to discover ¡¥embedded meaning¡¦ and to explore reasons for behaviour (van Manen, 1977; Crick, 1994; Miles and Huberman, 1994; Dann and Phillips, 2000). The interpretivist approach is often used in studies of lived experiences (Smith and Weed, 2007). Narrative analysis was used to investigate the ¡¥stories¡¦ that were gathered in this study (both inter- views and biographical texts). Morgan (2007, p. 367) observes that elements of an experience include the meanings created by an individual and derived from ¡¥personal narratives and shared cultural values¡¦. Other studies (e.g. Smith and Weed, 2007; Voase, 2007) also note the importance of narratives in understanding personal experiences. The interviewees were asked to tell the researcher how they came to undertake their first frontier travel experiences and were then asked about their reasons or motivations for doing so. They generally began to spontaneously tell the story of their frontier travel experiences, with the researcher taking the role of the listener and offering prompting questions where required. ¡¥The listeners there- fore immediately become active co-participants in the recounting of a narrative¡¦ (Elliott, 2005, p. 10). The interviewer tried to take a back seat as much as possible and let the stories flow
without unnecessary interruption. Sometimes, these stories were lengthy, while others were more accurately characterised as vignettes or snippets, used by the interviewee to illustrate a particular motivation or key part of their travel experience. The plot might have been shaped by the occasional question asked by the interviewer, but largely this was left to the interviewee.  While the interviewer was the main intended audience for these stories, the fact that the interviews were taped suggests that the inter- viewees understood that there would be other potential audiences for their narrative (Bern- stein, 1997; Elliott, 2005), i.e. through published academic works of the interviewer and any co- researcher(s), even though the interviewees¡¦ identity was concealed by a pseudonym. This fact might perhaps have influenced some of the stories being told, although the degree is hard to quantify. Some interviews were also conducted at public places such as local cafes, and interviewees might therefore have been influenced by the fact that other patrons could have overheard all or part of the interviews. It should also be borne in mind that many of these stories might have been ¡¥well-rehearsed¡¦ as the interviewee had often presented accounts of their travels to the public through lectures or via media interviews, or the retelling may lead to changes in the original narrative (Gudmundsdottir, 2006, p. 225). This does not, however, make them any less meaningful as a way to understand the frontier traveller, given that adventure can be understood as a ¡¥performed kinaesthetic experience¡¦ (Cater and Cloke, 2007, p. 14). These frontier experiences are arguably carried out in the knowledge that the general public will be interested in their exploits, with the latter acting as a form of audience, ¡¥supporting and willing participants to successful completion of their adventure¡¦ (Cater and Cloke, 2007, p. 15). It is also the case that the retelling of stories may lead to ex- ploration of the ¡¥deeper meaning of events¡¦ (Gudmundsdottir, 2006, p. 225), created jointly through the voices of informant and researcher.In the case of the books being analysed, theworks were in the public domain and the stories were extracted from the literary texts by the researcher. The original audience was thus

the readership of the book, which might perhaps have led to the stories being some- what ¡¥enhanced¡¦ to make them more interest- ing or readable. This, however, is consistent with the point made above; that these travel experiences are often undertaken with an eye to the interest of the general public, the media and their peers in these kinds of pursuits.  There is no single method of narrative analy- sis of qualitative material (Elliott, 2005) and a variety of approaches are potentially available to the researcher. The method selected for this study was a focus on narrative content, particu- larly the ¡¥choice of metaphors and other images that are invoked¡¦ (Elliott, 2005, p. 38) when attempting to describe the frontier travel expe- rience. This analysis therefore focuses on what the accounts of the participants tell us about these experiences, forming part of the social world (Smith, 2000; Elliott, 2005). The analysis can also be conceptualised as paradigmatic (Polkinghorne, 1995; Smith and Weed, 2007), in that the researcher conducts a type of content analysis to tease out themes from the narrative data, in order to produce overarching catego- ries or typologies that unite these themes. ¡¥The power of paradigmatic thought is to bring order to experience by seeing individual things as belonging to a category¡¦ (Polkinghorne, 1995, p. 10).The analysis of interview transcripts andtexts used in this study revealed a number of references to metaphors or imagery. Imagery, according to Tannen (1989, p. 2), refers to visual images depicted within discourse or conversa- tion, in the sense of ¡¥previously experienced visual impressions, things and people seen rather than heard¡¦. They can also be viewed more broadly as mental constructs or ¡¥repre- sentations¡¦, which can derive from any of the sensory domains, not just the visual (Echtner and Ritchie, 2003; Featherstone and Hepworth, 2005). The latter definition has been used in the current study. The process and influences on image formation have been the subject of a number of tourism studies, primarily with respect to destination image, the role of image in the travel decision-making process and the factors influencing destination image forma- tion (see for example Echtner and Ritchie, 2003; Beerli and Martin, 2004; O¡¦Leary and Deegan, 2005). This paper, however, focuses on the way
that imagery is conveyed by the frontier travel- lers taking part in the current study ¡X in both oral and written discourse ¡X particularly through the use of metaphors.  Metaphors can be understood as ways of comparing two ¡¥different things on the basis of the characteristics they share¡¦ (Elgin, 1993, p. 146). Gibbs et al. (2004) note that the basis of metaphors is often image schema. The latter refers to ¡¥dynamic spatial patterns¡¦ that are ¡¥more abstract than ordinary visual mental images¡¦ and of an enduring nature, being ¡¥per- manent properties of embodied experience¡¦ (Gibbs et al., 2004, pp. 1192¡V1193). Lakoff (1993, p. 202) observes that the term ¡¥meta- phor¡¦ should be reserved for the conceptualisa- tion of ¡¥one mental domain in terms of another¡¦, rather than mere linguistic expressions. This paper, however, will use the term ¡¥metaphor¡¦ in its more colloquial sense to refer to the meta- phorical expressions or language used by partici- pants. It will be distinguished from ¡¥imagery¡¦, which is used in this paper to denote the images or imaginative comparisons underpinning these metaphors.Lengkeek (2000, p. 14) refers to the provisionof ¡¥new contexts and meaning¡¦ through metaphor, such that they can become ¡¥every- day reality¡¦. Metaphor can therefore be used to minimise unfamiliarity (Dann, 2002) by com- paring one concept with something else better known or understood. This might explain their frequency of use in a frontier travel context, where the traveller is necessarily exploring or visiting places where few others have gone and may struggle to find words to make sense of what they have seen or experienced to others. Some metaphors are so ubiquitous and overused in everyday speech as to be almost clich? (Dann, 2002), but even the use of an overworked metaphor may suggest a particu- lar way of viewing the world and be of interest in better understanding the way a particular individual draws meaning from an experience. The frontier traveller may be using well-worn metaphors such as the comparison of the fron- tier with a female, but their frequency of use and emphasis across the set of participants in this study suggests that they have a particular resonance for this type of traveller.The next sections of this paper explore someof the imagery and metaphors used by frontier

travellers in reference to their journeys. While these constructs have been dealt with sepa- rately, for ease of analysis, the final section of this paper will pull together the various strands and examine the relationship between myth, heroic journeys and fantasy for the frontier traveller in a holistic sense.  Quotes from interview participants will be attributed to pseudonyms in italics, to distin- guish them from quotes made by authors of texts about frontier travel, another source of data used in this study. While data were col- lected with respect to a number of individuals, not all study participants are cited or referred to in this paper. Instead, the following analysis uses illustrative examples, based on data gathered, to explore the metaphors and imagery used by frontier travellers that were common across the data set in this study. The most com- monly noted metaphors and imagery appeared to be those dealing with exploration/the explor- er¡¦s journey and desire/passion within the fron- tier travel experience, which were often found in conjunction with each other. None of the metaphors and imagery discussed below were exclusive to a single frontier traveller.DESIRE AND PASSIONFrontier travellers often paint the object of their travels in language reminiscent of a lover. The frontier is typically seen as a woman (Humber- stone and Pedersen, 2001) either untouched or unspoilt like a ¡¥virgin¡¦ or alluring and seduc- tive, with the explorer Scott a case in point according to Sara Wheeler (1996, pp. 49¡V50). ¡¥The Antarctic possessed a virginity, in his mind, that provided an alternative to the spoiled and messy world¡¦. Wheeler (1996, p. 50) also notes of Scott, ¡¥He wrote in his diary about, ¡§the terrible vulgarising which Shackleton has introduced to the Southern field of enterprise, hitherto so clean and wholesome¡¨ ¡¦.  There are numerous examples of the ¡¥virgin¡¦ metaphor used by frontier travellers when describing the landscape or the challenge of their endeavours. For example, Robert Ander- son (1995, p. 187) describes the attraction of ¡¥the unknown in making a first ascent¡¦ of a mountain in these terms: ¡¥The feeling of tread- ing virgin ground with surprises just around
the corner, makes ascending unclimbed moun- tains like finding diamonds in the ice¡¦. Sir Ranulph Fiennes similarly writes of the attrac- tion posed by ¡¥whole new ranges of virgin mountains¡¦ only recently ¡¥made available to Western climbers¡¦ in China (Fiennes, 1993, pp. 11¡V12).  The use of metaphors like this is not just limited to mountaineers or trekkers. Sailor Jim Shekhdar ¡¥wanted to do something nobody had done before, effectively to walk on virgin snow. That was my raison d¡¦?tre and, after some debate, I settled upon the idea of rowing, unsupported and alone, across the Pacific Ocean¡¦ (Shekhdar with Griffiths, 2001, p. 3).  References to Antarctica are particularly rife with this metaphorical language, which may be in part a subconscious nod to its relatively peaceful history and avoidance of imperialistic conquest. Karen notes the attraction of Antarc- tica¡¦s ¡¥purity¡¦ during a trek and Rod mentions the ¡¥unblemished snowfield¡¦ of its coastline. David Lewis, discussing his solo sailing voyage to Antarctica, writes, ¡¥The whole white conti- nent lay virgin, entrenched behind pack and berg and the furious storms of the ¡§screaming sixties¡¨ ¡¦ (Lewis, 1975, p. 19).  The metaphor might be linked to a ¡¥discourse of power¡¦ (Dann, 1996, p. 28), with the traveller wishing to subdue or dominate ¡¥virgin terri- tory¡¦. The land could in fact be a metaphor for their own fears and subconscious desire to ¡¥conquer¡¦ or master them through their travel experiences. Use of the virginity metaphor is, however, not confined to men. Bettina Selby (1988, p. 5¡V6), who journeyed to the source of the Nile in Africa, refers to uncharted regions she planned to visit in these terms:It didn¡¦t seem as if the available informa- tion about some parts of my route had increased all that much from the days when map-makers filled in the blank spaces with whatever came to mind; the thought that I might be pedaling through virgin territory gave me an anticipatory shiver of excitement.  Others use the metaphor of a ¡¥siren¡¦ when describing the frontier, calling them to danger- ous pursuits and not able to be easily resisted, again using feminine imagery. Humberstone

and Pederson (2001, p. 24) note that ¡¥wilder- ness places . . . may become symbols and markers for hegemonic masculinity¡¦, and this appears to be manifested in these examples of language of seduction, passion and desire. Doug, a mountain climber, uses language asso- ciated with love and sexual activity when describing his travel experiences (¡¥totally swept away by it¡¦, ¡¥romantically adventurous¡¦, ¡¥gets my blood racing¡¦ and ¡¥(I) bask in the glow of another one over¡¦). Harry likewise refers to his ¡¥journeying through a place and trying to absorb it¡¦ as ¡¥a difficult marriage¡¦ and Rod talks about the ¡¥honeymoon period of being on a new (polar) expedition¡¦. David Lewis observes that he ¡¥had become embroiled in a love affair ¡X with the sea. (Women and the sea have much in common, of course: both are subject to unpredictable change ¡X and would be boring if they were not) . . . It was inevita- ble, I suppose, that the call of distant seas should become irresistible¡¦ (Lewis, 1975, pp. 14¡V15). The diver Pip?n Ferreras compares the temptations of the sea to feminine charms (Ferreras, 2004, p. 139):Jacques Mayol used to say that entering the water for a free dive was like making love to the ocean. And, indeed, the sea has often been described as a seductive siren, luring men into its often dangerous embrace. That was a lot to compete with . . .  These metaphors may be a way of explain- ing away or justifying the frontier travellers¡¦ fixation with or fascination for extreme travel experiences. The traveller, like an ardent lover, is swept away by their feelings and rendered powerless to resist the attraction of the frontier. Use of this metaphor appears to be more typi- cally associated with male frontier travellers, with some females referring to their experi- ences in terms of a romance; potentially a less threatening and gentler experience. For example, Alexandra Tolstoy is ¡¥greatly drawn by the romance of travelling¡¦ (Tolstoy, 2003, p. 4) along the Silk Road and explains some of the lure of her journey by the historical associa- tions of some of the places she visits: ¡¥To me Samarkand conjures up more romance than Paris or Rome ever could. Its very name
suggests adventure, intrigue and the mystery of the Orient¡¦ (Tolstoy, 2003, p. 31). Sometimes the fantasy of romance disappoints and reality intrudes. Ben Kozel, for example, found that reaching the end of his river rafting journey was less charming or picturesque than he had originally dreamed of (Kozel, 2002, p. 313). ¡¥There was none of the imagined romance in this moment. I was not standing on a golden beach, squinting into a rising sun. And no salty breeze ruffled the curls of my hair . . . I was cold. I was wet¡¦.  These metaphors and imagery, conceptual- ising the frontier as a virgin, untouched and ready to be challenged or seduced or ¡¥ripe¡¦ for romance, highlight an interesting mythical dimension to frontier travel. Ironically, this ideal of pure untouched wilderness is progres- sively being eroded in modern society, with Vince et al. (2005, p. 20) arguing that ¡¥popula- tion numbers and affluence increasingly are making the old dichotomy between wilderness and development obsolete¡¦.FATE OR DESTINYFrontier journeys may also be described as ¡¥fateful¡¦ or the result of kismet or destiny, which adds to their numinous or magical quality in the minds of the traveller. Harry, an adventurer, describes how ¡¥I had this great longing to fulfil what seemed like a destiny¡¦, while for Virginia Morell, a trip to find the source of the Blue Nile ¡¥was, of course, my destiny¡¦ (Morell, 2001, p. 68) ¡X something which was inevitable and thus could not be avoided. Morell recalls the Ethiopian word for destiny ¡X eddileh ¡X which she describes as ¡¥a rainbow in one¡¦s life, where destiny has stepped in to hand you something rare and unexpected¡¦ (Morell, 2001, p. 68). She describes her destiny thus: ¡¥as if something had to happen in a particular way; there was no other possi- bility¡¦ (Morell, 2001, p. 68). In a similar vein, Aaron related that ¡¥I knew I¡¦d go to the North Pole someday, even when I was a little six- year-old boy¡¦.This reference to destiny may be linked todreams and fantasies of the frontier traveller, with the individual seeing himself or herself as a hero or heroine ¡¥fated¡¦ or chosen to carry out a particular task or journey (Campbell, 1968,

1990). This makes the traveller feel unique or special, having been granted a responsibility or opportunity not open to or offered to others in the ¡¥everyday¡¦ world, and might bestow upon the journey a mythic dimension.MYTHS AND LEGENDSThe frontier journey, as well as the frontier itself, is often linked with mythical constructs. Butler (1996, p. 216), for example, notes that the ¡¥myth of the frontier has been a powerful one¡¦, and argues that it may therefore ¡¥be an important part of its appeal as a potential tourist destination¡¦. Frontier travel experiences are described by exponents as ¡¥quests¡¦ in almost Arthurian language, or as odysseys, evoking the heroic journey and a desire for transforma- tion through trials, in places ¡¥outside one¡¦s own common realm of experience¡¦ (Zurick, 1995, p. 137). Doug refers to having ¡¥a great epic¡¦ when climbing mountains, while Harry conceptualises his frontier travel experiences as ¡¥long quests¡¦:In a sense my journeys are the classic odyssey; Odysseus set out and came back, having had all these experiences, which tested him and so on. But I don¡¦t want to compare myself too much to a classical hero but there is that sort of element of setting out to learn and then coming back . . .  Myth and legend surrounding the deaths of climbers Mallory and Irvine on Mount Everest in the 1920s was a key motivation behind the more recent expedition undertaken by David Roberts and Conrad Anker to recover their bodies. Roberts labels this a ¡¥quest¡¦ to ¡¥redis- cover Mallory himself, the visionary lost explorer whose body Conrad Anker found, and whose fate we may at last begin to divine¡¦ (Anker and Roberts, 1999, p. 16). Mallory¡¦s body takes on the guise of the Holy Grail, and even Roberts concedes that Mallory and Irvine¡¦s disappearance has been elevated, ¡¥to the realm of the mythic¡¦ (Anker and Roberts, 1999, p. 139) due to historical conjecture as to whether they reached the summit before they died. Another climber, Thom Pollard, who discovered Mallory¡¦s body during that
expedition, also expresses deep respect to a fallen ¡¥hero¡¦ (Anker and Roberts, 1999, p. 139). Tim Cope sought to ride a bike across Russia, Siberia, Mongolia and China, which he describes as ¡¥a realm of mythical places, far off wonderlands . . . It was a prospect that tempted my imagination . . .¡¦ (Cope and Hatherly, 2003, pp. 1¡V2). David Breashears felt the same sense of the extraordinary as a child of ten living in Greece, confronted by Mount Olympus: ¡¥I remember longing to climb it and search for traces of mythic gods and ancient warriors¡¦ (Breashears, 1999, p. 33). Bettina Selby refers to fabled tales of old when describing her journey to the source of the Nile (Selby, 1988, p. 8): ¡¥I thought I would ride in a leisurely manner along the seaboard of the delta, from Alexan- dria to Port Said, seeing all the famous places that had been a legend to me for so long¡¦. The legends, for Selby, give the destination a momentous, venerable quality, imparting a sense of significance and meaning beyond the place itself. This ties in with Rojek¡¦s (1997) view that myth is used by individuals to bringmeaning to places visited.THE EXPLORER¡¦S JOURNEYA subset of mythic journeys involves retracing historic expeditions or following in the foot- steps of famous travellers or explorers. This desire of individuals to ¡¥role play¡¦ and act out narratives has been identified in the travel context, and its importance in ¡¥play¡¦ has been particularly noted by Gyim?thy and Mykletun (2004, p. 865), who describe how Arctic trek- kers in their study used ¡¥harsh environmental conditions and hard physical activities . . . to inscribe themselves into an idealized ¡¥explorer¡¦ or ¡¥pioneer¡¦ role¡¦. Hall (2002, p. 295) cites ecolo- gist Aldo Leopold as arguing that ¡¥the oppor- tunity to relive or imagine the experiences of pioneers or the ¡§frontier¡¨ that formed national culture . . . was an essential component of the value of wilderness and wilderness recreation¡¦. This is illustrated by the following comment of Geoff, a polar trekker and sailor: ¡¥It actually motivates me in a way, to know that I¡¦m not alone, in the fact that this is an old path that I take¡¦. Helen refers to the ¡¥first people¡¦ who attempted the ascent of Mount Everest and

notes that she was climbing ¡¥in their footsteps, hopefully with the same mindset¡¦.  Some frontier travellers are careful to distin- guish between their own exploits and those of famous explorers. As Keith, a pilot and bal- loonist, notes, ¡¥I¡¦m an adventurer . . . Mawson¡¦s an explorer. An explorer is a person who goes somewhere where no one has ever been and quite often is doing it for scientific reasons. And that¡¦s what Mawson was. I¡¦m an adven- turer . . . I do it for the spirit of adventure. And there¡¦s a big difference¡¦. Graham, a desert trekker, observes that, ¡¥I was born two hundred years too late . . . there¡¦s nothing left to explore . . . all I can do is go and retrace what someone¡¦s already done¡¦.  Harry notes that there is ¡¥an imperialistic thread running through Western tradition of exploration¡¦. For Bettina Selby however, a fantasy of Empire and the ¡¥golden age¡¦ of exploration are woven across part of her journey through Africa, which she describes as in the ¡¥footsteps¡¦ of Victorian traveller and novelist Amelia B. Edwards. Prior to Selby¡¦s departure, she spent hours reading atlases and books of African exploration, leading to dreams that ¡¥began to be peopled by long trains of porters bearing Fortnum and Mason hampers. Armies of fanatical ¡§Fuzzy Wuzzies¡¨ boiled out of the desert behind their Mahdi, hurling themselves against ¡§thin red lines¡¨ of pith- helmeted soldiers with Kitchener moustaches¡¦ (Selby, 1988, p. 7). This ¡¥aura of empire¡¦ (Selby, 1988, p. 120) also encompasses following in the footsteps of the ¡¥heroic¡¦ colonial explorers, whom she later refers to as ¡¥my Victorian fore- runners¡¦ (Selby, 1988, p. 228). Jamal et al. (2003, p. 149), citing Gregory (2001), refer to the phe- nomenon of ¡¥a nostalgia for colonialism itself, a desire to recreate and recover the world of late Victorian and Edwardian colonialism in all its majestic glory¡¦. Selby¡¦s description of her travel experience evokes images of exploration and colonial splendour, a self-confessed ¡¥dream state¡¦.DREAMS, MYSTERY AND ILLUSIONMany frontier travellers in this study referred to their travel experiences using the metaphor of a dream. For example, Alex, a round-the- world sailor, notes, ¡¥Getting back, I say this
fairly often, was just like waking up from a dream, as in the trip was a dream. So you wake up and you¡¦re in your normal world again . . .¡¦ Michael Asher also ascribes dreamlike quali- ties to the Sahara desert during his journey (Asher, 1988, p. 280¡V281): ¡¥a place where con- scious and unconscious, dream and reality, came together¡¦.  Frontier travel experiences may also be described as magical or linked with mystery. This perhaps links to the propensity for fron- tier travellers to refer to their destinations as otherworldly or ¡¥alien¡¦ ¡X they are not quite ¡¥of this world¡¦. This is illustrated by Robyn David- son, who describes her solo journey with camels across the Outback in illusory terms before she departs (Davidson, 1980, p. 95), and notes how its magic affected other people she knew or met:From the day the thought came into my head ¡¥I am going to enter a desert with camels¡¦ to the day I felt the preparations to be completed, I had built something intangible but magical for myself which had rubbed off a little on to other people, and I would probably never have the opportunity to do anything quite so demanding or as fulfilling as that ever again.  The reality of what she sees and experiences in the Outback supersedes even her wildest imaginings. Davidson describes the enchant- ment of the desert as a magical realm from a fairytale (Davidson, 1980, p. 218): ¡¥Nothing as wildly beautiful as that had I ever seen, even in my dream landscapes¡¦. Bear Grylls uses similar language when discussing his emo- tions upon reaching the summit of Everest (Grylls, 2000, p. 254): ¡¥The views I saw and the magic I felt during those precious few minutes will remain embedded in me for ever. They had surpassed my wildest imagination. I knew that I could never forget¡¦. Harry sees his jour- neys as attempts ¡¥to capture perhaps that magic that I¡¦d sensed as a child¡¦.  It is interesting that this element of illusion or a dream state exists alongside a strong desire for authenticity of experience for many frontier travellers (Hamilton, 2000; Hillary and Elder, 2003). This supports in part the contention of

MacCannell (1976), that ¡¥tourism is a metaphor for the general inauthenticity of modern life, where the tourist journeys away from moder- nity¡¦s artifices in search of authentic objects and experiences elsewhere¡¦, but also the view of Feifer (1985) that the post-tourist is seeking experiences that are unique, extraordinary and novel. The focus on the extraordinary as it relates to the imaginary world is also present in the metaphors and imagery linked to fantasies or fairytales.FANTASIES AND FAIRY TALESZurick (1995, p. 61) notes that fantasy ¡¥predates the journey and continually propels it along new courses¡¦, and the fairytale aspects of tourism have been considered by several aca- demics, including Jafari and Gardner (1991) and Dann (1996). The latter observes that tour- ists ¡¥are caught up in a fairy-tale world of childhood¡¦ (Dann, 1996, p. 123), and Gyim?thy and Mykletun (2004, p. 865¡V866) see this fantasy element manifested in travellers, such as Arctic trekkers, who ¡¥invent substitute worlds, supplement versions of reality, or inscribe themselves into the new identities¡¦; in their case, the ¡¥explorer¡¦ or ¡¥pioneer¡¦. Dann (1996, p. 124) cites a number of accounts of exploration where individuals ¡¥sometimes viewed the new territories they discovered in terms of fairyland¡¦ (see also Thomas, 1952; Cocker, 1992). This type of fantasy can form shared narratives within a community of trav- ellers, as identified by Belk and Costa (1998, p. 220) with their focus on recreated mountain rendezvous: ¡¥Certain fantasies have the bene- fits of scripts and motifs¡¦.Fairytales and fantasies were evoked by par-ticipants such as Keith, who says of ballooning, ¡¥I¡¦d visualised it being this wonderful magic carpet ride¡¦, using language reminiscent of The Arabian Nights, and Ross, who refers to moun- tains looking ¡¥like they were something out of a Tolkien novel . . . just like a fantasy¡¦. Evan saw balloon flights as ¡¥the stuff of fairytales¡¦, while Marinetta Asher (Asher, 1988, p. 265) describes the desert in terms of Perrault¡¦s The Sleeping Beauty. ¡¥It¡¦s like an enchanted world ¡X the colours, the rainbow, the stillness. It¡¦s like a place that is sleeping under a spell¡¦.  
For Bear Grylls, Mount Everest is a ¡¥place of dreams¡¦ (Grylls, 2000, p. 41) and he describes his climb through the foothills in his diary using language straight from the Brothers Grimm (Grylls, 2000, p. 52): ¡¥Vast mountains, the biggest in our world, rise straight up all around us, and when the wind blows through the valleys where we are, it feels as if the giants are stamping their heels¡¦. Alex initially searched for ¡¥a physical paradise¡¦ in the Edenic sense but found that ultimately it resided in companion- ship and ¡¥the human interaction and the harmony and the working together¡¦ rather than a beautiful landscape: ¡¥That is the closest you can get to paradise¡¦.  Part of the fantasy connected to frontier travel experiences may be related to role play. Dann (1976, p. 22) notes that ¡¥travel allows the individual the opportunity to build an envi- ronment for acting out psychic needs, and the playing of certain roles which cannot be fulfilled at home¡¦. This is illustrated by round-the-world balloonist Brian Jones, who experiences a fantasy of being an astronaut as he prepares to board his balloon, and feels he is ¡¥re-enacting¡¦ heroic flights of the past (Piccard and Jones, 1999, p. 14):As we drive slowly towards it, with the balloon growing bigger and bigger in our eyes, my mind flew back thirty years to the launch of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. In 1969 I had watched enthralled on television as the crew went aboard, and now I felt we were re-enacting the scene.  Using role play to re-enact fantasies is also echoed in the theatrical metaphors and imagery used by travellers when discussing their experiences and motivations behind frontier travel.PERFORMANCE AND ¡¥PLAY¡¦Frontier travel may involve an element of the theatrical, and the metaphors and imagery revealed in this current study support this. Celsi et al. (1993) refer to high-risk activities as being motivated, to a degree, by a ¡¥dramatic world-view¡¦ in Western society, which has its roots in classical Greek theatre and involves

conflict and tension-building finally released or solved through ¡¥denouement¡¦, which leads to a purification or release known as ¡¥cathar- sis¡¦. Zurick (1995, p. 137) also uses performance imagery in his discussion of the ¡¥back¡¦ of ¡¥national frontiers¡¦, those remote peripheries that are contrasted with the ¡¥front¡¦ or staged elements, such as enactments and ceremonies ¡¥put on¡¦ for entertainment or ¡¥amusement¡¦ of tourists. This imagery may not be unique to the frontier or independent traveller, according to the literature. Weaver (2005) uses performative metaphors in a study of the cruise industry, while Urbain (1993) considers the behaviour of some tourists returning home as akin to an actor, with ¡¥roles¡¦ undertaken during travel ¡¥carried over¡¦ and souvenirs likened to ¡¥accom- panying stage props¡¦ (Dann, 1996). Mordue (2005, p. 180) also refers to the recent focus of researchers on ¡¥performance as a metaphor for tourist practice¡¦.Paradoxically, as discussed above, the fron-tier traveller appears keen to limit, if not elimi- nate, the ¡¥front¡¦ stage, seeking a more authentic or ¡¥real¡¦ experience, while still describing the experience using theatrical elements and imagery. For example, Evan expressly states that he enjoys the ¡¥theatre¡¦ of frontier travel: ¡¥The fact that it¡¦s perceived by the general public to be absolutely terrifying is fine, because that¡¦s all part of the theatre¡¦. Creating theatre around frontier travel, for this individ- ual, appears to involve playing up risks, high- lighting the drama and involving the audience (the public) in an active way so that they take a personal interest in what is happening. They are not taken ¡¥backstage¡¦ to discover the truth behind risks, that they are less dramatic than they appear to the ¡¥audience¡¦. Other potential audiences might be the media, sponsors or even peers. As round-the-world sailor Hugo Vihlen notes of his journey (Vihlen, 1971, p. 183): ¡¥The trip has been a great experience and a test of myself in many ways, but it¡¦s not something that I would do if I thought no one else in the world cared about it¡¦. The ultimate audience of course for the frontier traveller is the self. Ian Brown saw walking to the South Pole as offering a chance for self-exploration: ¡¥Our (polar) venture was a journey into our- selves as well as into a mysterious physical realm¡¦ (Brown, 1999, p. 14).  
Mountaineers such as Robert Anderson often use theatrical language when describing their motivations, for example using imagery of being ¡¥onstage¡¦ or in the ¡¥spotlight¡¦ when climbing mountains. Anderson labels climbing Mount Everest ¡¥the public finale¡¦ (1995, p. 201) to his attempt to climb the highest peak on each continent, while Andrew Lindblade (2001, p. 231) refers to ¡¥the often serious scenarios played out when in the mountains¡¦. For David Breashears, ¡¥Bouldering was my rehearsal call; climbing was my performance¡¦ (Breashears, 1999, p. 53). He saw climbing ¡¥not just as a sport, but as a form of expression . . . I wanted to make my climbing an expression of compe- tence and grace¡¦ (Breashears, 1999, p. 46). The desert reminds adventurer Benedict Allen of a minimalist set (Allen, 1992, p. 282). ¡¥Once, years ago at school, we had done a play, Beckett¡¦s Waiting for Godot. This camp had the same emptiness as the set, the inaction of the characters¡¦.Exploring  the  theatrical  metaphors  andimagery behind frontier travel might be a useful area for future research, as it appears to support the work of Gyim?thy and Mykletun (2004) on adventure as a form of ¡¥deep play¡¦, following Ackerman (1999). It could also be linked to searching out new roles or identity within travel, providing the opportunity for a ¡¥dislocation of self from the ordinary to the extraordinary . . .¡¦ (Beedie and Hudson, 2003, p. 625).  This paper will now consider the ways in which metaphors and imagery discussed in this section illuminate our understanding of the frontier travel experience, as well as the implications of these findings for the market- ing of these experiences and tourism more generally.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONThe analysis of the biographical texts and interview data used in this study reveals a common discourse or paradigm of the perfor- mance of adventure, where the traveller is fol- lowing in the footsteps of explorers of old and performing a role based on heroic or mythic journeys of the past, as well as aspects of fai- rytale and fantasy. Within this metempsychotic approach to travel, the individual may be free

to take on a new identity or enact a new role for himself or herself (Edensor, 2000). Each of the metaphors or imagery used helps to shape our understanding of the frontier travel experi- ence, which appears to be based on the acting out or the re-enacting of stories or narratives from the past for a real or imagined audience that is eager to hear of their exploits. This adventurous role play is both a motivation and the frame for the travel experience. The travel- ler is the hero or heroine of his or her own mythological journey and must heed the ¡¥call to adventure¡¦ (Campbell, 1968). This narrative or myth of adventure is then used by the trav- eller to enact and interpret their experiences at the frontier. Once home, the triumph of the returning hero is celebrated in print and in person, through public presentations and doc- umentaries. The drama of the frontier travel experience is thus often re-enacted by the trav- eller when they return home and potentially inspires further mythic journeys, perpetuating the tradition of great explorers and the mythol- ogy of adventure.This paper reveals the benefits of employingnarrative analysis in research on tourist experi- ences. Polkinghorne (1995, p. 5) notes that the increasing interest in this research method is well deserved, as narrative is ¡¥uniquely suited for displaying human existence as situated action¡¦, and thus exploring human behaviour through the linguistic form. Analysis of the language used by travellers when describing travel experiences appears to be a useful way to develop a greater understanding of how and why people travel and the meanings that they bestow upon those experiences, given that travel often has a mythical dimension (Johns and Clarke, 2001; Johns and Gyim?thy, 2002) and myth is a ¡¥type of speech¡¦ and form of expression (Barthes, 1973). The participants discussed in this paper used a common set of metaphors to describe their experiences. The use of metaphor is ¡¥pervasive in everyday life [and] what we experience and what we do . . . is very much a matter of metaphor¡¦ (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, 2003, p. 3). Metaphors can there- fore help us to understand how people ¡¥both think and act¡¦, even if they are largely uncon- scious of these concepts, and how they govern our lives (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). While this study focused on the frontier traveller,
other forms of travel experiences might also be analysed using a similar technique to help illu- minate our understanding of the tourist and their world.  Some of the metaphors and imagery un- covered during this study of frontier travel experiences might potentially be useful in future marketing of these experiences, as well as to adventure travel or tourism generally. For example, metaphors connected with theatre and performance might be able to be incorpo- rated in marketing collateral, by the use of words such as ¡¥arena¡¦ or ¡¥stage¡¦ to describe the experience, given the fact that tourism is largely a performed experience (Cater and Cloke, 2007) and tourism marketers often sell ¡¥stages and playgrounds¡¦ (Vester, 1987). Other metaphors such as sexual imagery revolving around feel- ings of desire and conquest or the fantasy of the frontier as pure and untouched could also be used to frame these intense experiences for its intended audience. These myths of adventure appear to be relevant for the frontier travellers participating in this study and potentially more widely held by other tourists, given the current fascination with risk and desire for novelty withinpopularcultureandthegrowingdemand for adventure tourism experiences (Puchan, 2004; Cater, 2006; Cater and Cloke, 2007; Schott, 2007). It could be argued that the mythology of adventure illustrates Barthes¡¦ (1973) contention that myths are essentially culturally constructed values or beliefs, invested in this case in the idea of the adventurer as the modern-day heir to the past luminaries of exploration.While frontier travel is still largely availableonly to a small market niche, both because of the risky nature and high cost of these experi- ences and the fact that they take place in some of the most fragile environments on the planet (literally ¡¥off the planet¡¦ in the case of space tourism experiences), they can also be seen as one end of a spectrum of activity or adventure tourism (Hill, 1995; Swarbrooke et al., 2003; Pomfret, 2006) or as a stage of adventure (Mort- lock, 1984). This paper goes some way towards shedding some light on the extraordinary experiences of the frontier traveller and how the adventure myth that underpins them might be potentially linked to a broader travel context, based on a collective cultural narrative of heroism and exploration.
