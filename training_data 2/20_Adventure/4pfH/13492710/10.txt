abstract
Exercise has been associated with posttraumatic growth in gynecologic cancer survivors (GCS) but the
role of extreme/adventure activities has not been investigated. The primary objective of this study was to
examine the association between extreme/adventure activities and posttraumatic growth in GCS. A
Canadian provincial registry generated a random sample of 2064 GCS stratified by cancer type (i.e.,
cervical, endometrial, and ovarian) who were mailed a self-report survey that assessed demographic and
medical variables, posttraumatic growth, participation and interest in extreme/adventure activities, and
exercise growth (i.e., the extent to which the cancer diagnosis itself prompted changes in the amount,
type, or nature of exercise activities). Of 621 GCS, only 12.1% reported participating in extreme/adventure
activities in the past year. Of 309 GCS interested in a future exercise study, 41.1% were interested in trying
extreme/adventure activities. After adjustment for key covariates, neither participation nor interest in
extreme/adventure activities were associated with posttraumatic growth. All exercise growth items,
however, were significantly associated with all posttraumatic growth scales (all p's < 0.05). In multivariate regression analyses, exercise growth items explained 37.2% of the variance in the posttraumatic
growth inventory, 7.2% of the variance in the negative impact of cancer scale, 19.9% of the variance in the
positive impact of cancer scale, and 23% of the variance in the benefit finding scale (all p's < 0.001). GCS
who change the amount, type, and/or nature of their exercise activities after their diagnosis may be more
likely to experience posttraumatic growth.

1. Introduction
Although a cancer diagnosis can be extremely stressful and
traumatic, it may also provide an opportunity for positive growth
and adaptation (Linley & Joseph, 2004; Love & Sabiston, 2011;
Morris, Shakespeare-Finch, & Scott, 2007). Posttraumatic growth
is defined as a positive psychological change that emerges
following a significantly challenging or traumatic life event and is
often characterized by an increased appreciation for life, better
interpersonal relationships, personal strength, recognition of new
possibilities, and spiritual development (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996;
Tedeschi, Park, & Calhoun, 1998). Posttraumatic growth is theorized
to occur when a life crisis or traumatic event is challenging enough
that it prompts cognitive processing of the event and its aftermath.
Posttraumatic growth theory suggests that individual styles of
managing distress, social support, and disclosure regarding emotions and perspectives on the traumatic event, as well as cognitive
processing of the traumatic event, can lead to schema changes,
change in life goals, and reduced psychological distress (Tedeschi &
Calhoun, 1996; Tedeschi et al., 1998).
Posttraumatic growth is a desired outcome of a cancer diagnosis; however, few interventions have been developed to promote
experiences of growth. We previously reported that meeting exercise guidelines was associated with some aspects of posttraumatic growth in gynecologic cancer survivors (GCS) (Crawford,
Vallance, Holt, & Courneya, 2014). Nevertheless, it is unknown
whether the nature of the exercise itself (i.e., the exercise modality
and context) may also be important for fostering posttraumatic
growth. Previous research has found that emotionally and physically demanding activities (e.g., mountaineering, dragon boating,
and group motorcycling) may prompt psychological growth in
cancer survivors (Burke & Sabiston, 2012; Dunn, Campbell, Penn,
Dwyer, & Chambers, 2009; Hefferon, Grealy, & Mutrie, 2008;

McDonough, Sabiston, & Ullrich-French, 2011; Sabiston, McDonough, & Crocker, 2007).
Based on posttraumatic growth theory and preliminary
research, we propose that activities that push cancer survivors
beyond their current capacity and provide a sense of accomplishment may be most likely to foster positive growth. Accordingly, we
propose that the optimal physical activities for stimulating posttraumatic growth would be physically challenging (i.e., a high
physiological demand), novel (i.e., not common or everyday activities), and contain some element of physical risk (i.e., potentially
serious injury if a mistake is made). The term “extreme/adventure
activities” has become a general descriptor for these types of activities (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2013). Moreover, we propose that
posttraumatic growth is most likely to occur when the cancer
diagnosis itself prompts the cancer survivor to participate in
extreme/adventure activities.
The primary objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and interest in extreme/adventure activities in GCS and
determine any associations with posttraumatic growth. Based on
posttraumatic growth theory and previous research (Burke &
Sabiston, 2012; Dunn et al., 2009; Hefferon et al., 2008;
McDonough et al., 2011; Sabiston et al., 2007), we hypothesized
that few GCS would be participating in extreme/adventure activities but that those GCS who were participating would report
higher posttraumatic growth. Based on previous research
(Blanchard et al., 2003), we also hypothesized that few GCS would
report their cancer diagnosis prompted them to substantially
change the amount, type, or nature of their exercise (i.e., reported
exercise growth) but those who did report exercise growth would
also report higher posttraumatic growth.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
The design and methods of this cross-sectional, populationbased study have been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014).
Ethical approval was granted by the Alberta Cancer Research Ethics
Board. Eligibility criteria included: (a) 18 years of age and (b)
histologically confirmed gynecologic (cervical, endometrial, or
ovarian) cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 2013. The Alberta
Cancer Registry generated a random sample of 2064 GCS stratified
by cancer type (688 from each survivor group) who were then
contacted by the registry on behalf of the researchers. The survey
was conducted between July and November 2013. Eligible GCS were
mailed a study package containing: (a) a letter of invitation from
the Registry explaining the purpose of the Registry and its role in
this specific study, (b) a letter from the researchers explaining the
study, (c) the survey booklet, and (d) a postage paid return envelope. The survey protocol followed a modified version of the Total
Design Method (Dillman, 2007) where participants were mailed (a)
the initial study package, (b) a postcard reminder 3e4 weeks later
to nonresponders, and (c) a second survey 3e4 weeks after that to
nonresponders to the initial survey and postcard reminder.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Demographic and medical information
Medical and demographic variables were assessed by self-report
and included age, marital status, education, annual income,
employment status, ethnicity, height and weight to calculate body
mass index (BMI), date of diagnosis, type of gynecologic cancer
(cervical, endometrial, ovarian), disease stage (localized, metastasized), previous and current treatments (surgery, radiation,
chemotherapy/drugs), previous recurrence (no or yes), and current
disease status (“cancer is gone” versus “still have cancer”).
2.2.2. Participation and interest in extreme/adventure activity
We were unaware of any published scales that have been validated for the assessment of extreme/adventure activities. Based on
definitions of extreme sport (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2013) and
adventure therapy (Epstein, 2004), we defined extreme/adventure
activities for participants as physically challenging activities
involving speed, height and/or a high level of physical exertion such
as mountaineering, white water rafting, triathlon, marathon, scuba
diving, rock climbing, dragon boating and downhill skiing.
Extreme/adventure activity participation was assessed using one
item (i.e., have you participated in any extreme/adventure activity
in the past year) with a yes or no response; and one open-ended
question (i.e., if yes, what type of extreme/adventure activity(ies)
did you do).
For participants interested in participating in a future exercise
study, we asked “would you be interested in trying any extreme/
adventure type activities” with a yes or no response. If participants
selected yes, they were asked to choose which extreme/adventure
activities they were most interested in trying from a list of options
that included wall/rock climbing, mountaineering (hiking),
triathlon, waterskiing/wakeboarding, river rafting, kayaking, scuba
diving, mountain biking, cross country skiing, downhill skiing,
horseback riding and other.
2.2.3. Posttraumatic growth
Given the exploratory nature of this study, posttraumatic
growth was assessed by three scales. The primary posttraumatic
growth scale was the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)
(Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI is a 21-item questionnaire
with a six-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (I did not experience
this change as a result of my crisis) to 5 (I experienced this change
as a result of my crisis). The PTGI is scored by the sum of the 21
items where higher scores indicated greater posttraumatic growth.
The Impact of Cancer Scale (IOC) was a second measure of posttraumatic growth (Zebrack, Yi, Petersen, & Ganz, 2008). The IOC
consists of 41 items comprising 5 positive subscales (health
awareness, positive self-evaluation, positive outlook, value of relationships, meaning of cancer) and 5 negative subscales (body
changes, negative self-evaluation, negative outlook, life interferences, health worry). Respondents indicated the extent to
which they agree from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
The Benefit Finding Scale (BFS) was used to assess the ways gynecologic cancer may have had a positive impact (Tomich & Helgeson,
2006). The BFS is a 14-item questionnaire with a 4-point scale
ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The BFS is scored by
summing the 14-items, with higher scores indicating more benefits
from cancer.
2.2.4. Exercise growth
We were interested in the extent to which a diagnosis and
treatment of gynecologic cancer may have prompted participation
in extreme/adventure activities but we were unaware of any validated scales assessing such a construct. Consequently, we
embedded six “exercise growth” items in the PTGI scale. As noted
earlier, the PTGI scale asks “how your diagnosis and treatment for
gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, or cervical) may have
changed your life” with responses ranging from 0 (I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis) to 5 (I experienced this
change as a result of my crisis). The six exercise growth items
focused on changes in the amount, type, and nature of exercise in
order to tap aspects related to physically challenging, novel, and
high risk extreme/adventure activities. The specific items were: “I
have significantly increased the amount of exercise I do”, “I have
36 J.J. Crawford et al. / Mental Health and Physical Activity 9 (2015) 35e40
tried new exercises I have never done before”, “I have taken up a
mind-body exercise such as yoga or tai chi”, “I have taken up a new
sport that I never played before such as tennis or golf”, “I have taken
up a physically challenging activity such as marathon running or
triathlon”, and “I have taken up a high risk sport or activity such as
rock climbing or white water rafting.”
2.2.5. Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL). We conducted analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs)
comparing those participating versus not participating and those
interested versus not interested in extreme/adventure activities on
the PTGI, PIOC, NIOC, and BFS. Our analyses adjusted for age, type of
cancer, BMI, months since diagnosis, radiation treatment, and
chemotherapy treatment. We also conducted ANCOVAs to examine
differences in posttraumatic growth based on the six exercise
growth items by creating four categories of exercise growth: (1) no
change (0 ¼ did not experience this change), (2) very small/small
change (1e2 ¼ changed to a very small/small degree), (3) moderate
change (3 ¼ changed to a moderate degree), and (4) great/very
great change (4e5 ¼ changed to a great/very great degree). Finally,
we performed forced entry multiple regression analyses to determine the independent associations of each of the six exercise
growth variables with PTGI, PIOC, NIOC, and BFS, adjusting for the
same variables as in our main analyses.
3. Results
Flow of participants through the study has been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014). Briefly, of the 2064 mailed surveys,
621 surveys were completed resulting in a completion rate of 30%
(621/2064) and a response rate of 38% (621/1626) excluding those
that were returned to sender or not eligible. Demographic and
medical data have been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014).
In summary, the mean age of participants was 60.8 ± 12.2 years,
71.5% were married, and 47.3% had completed university/college.
The mean BMI was 28.2 ± 6.6 with 64.4% of participants being
classified as overweight or obese. For type of cancer, 40.3% had
ovarian cancer, 27.4% had endometrial cancer, and 32.4% had cervical cancer. Based on the limited data available in the Alberta
Cancer Registry, we found our sample was similar to nonresponders in age, radiation treatment, and surgery treatment but
slightly over-represented ovarian cancer survivors, chemotherapy
treatment, and were closer to their date of diagnosis (Crawford
et al., 2014).
3.1. Participation and interest in extreme/adventure activities
Overall, 12.1% (n ¼ 75) of GCS reported that they had participated in an extreme/adventure activity over the past year (Table 1).
Downhill skiing was the most frequently reported activity (29.4%)
followed by mountaineering (17.5%) and cross-country skiing
(8.7%). Of the 309 (49.8%) GCS interested in a future exercise study,
41.1% (127 out of 309) indicated they would be interested in trying
an extreme/adventure activity. The extreme/adventure activity of
most interest was cross-country skiing (56.9%) followed by horseback riding (51.5%) and river rafting (41.5%).
3.2. Exercise growth
Descriptive statistics for the exercise growth variables are displayed in Table 2. Results indicated that GCS reported the largest
change for increasing the amount of exercise (38.8%) followed by
trying new exercises (32.4%), taking up mind body exercises
(16.3%), taking up a new sport (10.7%), taking up a physically
challenging activity (5.5%), and taking up a higher risk sport or
activity (2.8%).
3.3. Associations between extreme/adventure activities and
posttraumatic growth
ANCOVAs indicated no significant differences for participation
or interest in extreme/adventure activities for the PTGI, PIOC, NIOC,
and BFS (Table 3).
3.4. Associations between exercise growth and posttraumatic
growth
Table 4 reports the differences in posttraumatic growth based
on the exercise growth items. All exercise growth items were
significantly associated with all posttraumatic growth scales
(Ps < 0.05). In forced entry multivariate regression analyses, the
exercise growth items explained 37.2% (p < 0.001) of the variance in
PTGI, 7.2% (p < 0.001) of the variance in the NIOC, 19.9% (p < 0.001)
of the variance in the PIOC, and 23.0% of the variance in BFS. For the
PTGI, the significant independent correlates were increasing the
amount of exercise (b ¼ 0.36; p < 0.001), trying new exercises

(b ¼ 0.10; p ¼ 0.020).
4. Discussion
Our results showed that only 12.1% (n ¼ 75) of GCS reported
participating in extreme/adventure activities in the past year with
the most popular activities being downhill skiing, mountaineering,
and cross-country skiing. There are no published studies that have
examined extreme/adventure activity participation in cancer survivors with which to compare our results. This rate of participation
is higher than the 5% reported in the general adult population
(Tomlinson, Ravenscroft, Wheaton, & Gilchrist, 2005) although
participation rates have continued to grow (Brymer & Schweitzer,
2013). Interestingly, about 40% of GCS interested in participating
in a future exercise study were interested in trying extreme/
adventure activities with the strongest interest in cross country
skiing (56.9%), horseback riding (51.5%), and river rafting (41.5%).
These findings suggest that extreme/adventure activity interventions may be of interest to GCS despite limited current
participation.
GCS also reported modest exercise growth as a result of their
diagnosis. About one-third of GCS reported that their diagnosis and
treatments prompted them to increase the amount of exercise and
try new exercises; however, fewer than 10% reported that it
prompted them to take up a new sport, take up a physically challenging activity, or take up a high-risk sport or activity. The proportion of GCS that increased the amount of exercise is about
double that reported for breast and other cancer survivors
(Blanchard et al., 2003), suggesting that a GCS diagnosis may be
especially motivating for exercise behavior change. The reasons for
the low rate of change in terms of trying a new sport, a physically
challenging activity, or a high risk activity are unclear. It is possible
that the low rate of change in these variables may be due to the age
range of participants in the present study. Previously, extreme/
adventure activities tended to be popular among younger people;
however, the demographics of participants in extreme/adventure
sports are broadening to include people of all ages and women
(Celsi, Rose, & Leigh, 1993; Willig, 2008).
Contrary to our hypothesis, our data indicated that extreme/
adventure activity participation and interest was not associated
with posttraumatic growth. Observational research has indicated
that those who push their boundaries and overcome physical and
psychological challenges by taking up a new or physically challenging activities such as mountaineering, dragon boating, or
motorcycling, have reported improved posttraumatic growth
(Burke & Sabiston, 2012; Dunn et al., 2009; McDonough et al., 2011;
Sabiston et al., 2007). One potential explanation for our finding is
that a single participation in an extreme/adventure activity in the
past year may not be sufficient to change posttraumatic growth.
Unfortunately, we did not ask about the frequency of participation
in our survey. A second possible explanation is that the low
numbers of GCS who had participated in any extreme/adventure
activity may have limited our ability to find an association. Finally, it
is also possible that the GCS who participated in extreme/adventure activities in the past year were the same ones who had
participated prediagnosis, thereby, not experiencing any change in

abstract
Exercise has been associated with posttraumatic growth in gynecologic cancer survivors (GCS) but the
role of extreme/adventure activities has not been investigated. The primary objective of this study was to
examine the association between extreme/adventure activities and posttraumatic growth in GCS. A
Canadian provincial registry generated a random sample of 2064 GCS stratified by cancer type (i.e.,
cervical, endometrial, and ovarian) who were mailed a self-report survey that assessed demographic and
medical variables, posttraumatic growth, participation and interest in extreme/adventure activities, and
exercise growth (i.e., the extent to which the cancer diagnosis itself prompted changes in the amount,
type, or nature of exercise activities). Of 621 GCS, only 12.1% reported participating in extreme/adventure
activities in the past year. Of 309 GCS interested in a future exercise study, 41.1% were interested in trying
extreme/adventure activities. After adjustment for key covariates, neither participation nor interest in
extreme/adventure activities were associated with posttraumatic growth. All exercise growth items,
however, were significantly associated with all posttraumatic growth scales (all p's < 0.05). In multivariate regression analyses, exercise growth items explained 37.2% of the variance in the posttraumatic
growth inventory, 7.2% of the variance in the negative impact of cancer scale, 19.9% of the variance in the
positive impact of cancer scale, and 23% of the variance in the benefit finding scale (all p's < 0.001). GCS
who change the amount, type, and/or nature of their exercise activities after their diagnosis may be more
likely to experience posttraumatic growth.

1. Introduction
Although a cancer diagnosis can be extremely stressful and
traumatic, it may also provide an opportunity for positive growth
and adaptation (Linley & Joseph, 2004; Love & Sabiston, 2011;
Morris, Shakespeare-Finch, & Scott, 2007). Posttraumatic growth
is defined as a positive psychological change that emerges
following a significantly challenging or traumatic life event and is
often characterized by an increased appreciation for life, better
interpersonal relationships, personal strength, recognition of new
possibilities, and spiritual development (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996;
Tedeschi, Park, & Calhoun, 1998). Posttraumatic growth is theorized
to occur when a life crisis or traumatic event is challenging enough
that it prompts cognitive processing of the event and its aftermath.
Posttraumatic growth theory suggests that individual styles of
managing distress, social support, and disclosure regarding emotions and perspectives on the traumatic event, as well as cognitive
processing of the traumatic event, can lead to schema changes,
change in life goals, and reduced psychological distress (Tedeschi &
Calhoun, 1996; Tedeschi et al., 1998).
Posttraumatic growth is a desired outcome of a cancer diagnosis; however, few interventions have been developed to promote
experiences of growth. We previously reported that meeting exercise guidelines was associated with some aspects of posttraumatic growth in gynecologic cancer survivors (GCS) (Crawford,
Vallance, Holt, & Courneya, 2014). Nevertheless, it is unknown
whether the nature of the exercise itself (i.e., the exercise modality
and context) may also be important for fostering posttraumatic
growth. Previous research has found that emotionally and physically demanding activities (e.g., mountaineering, dragon boating,
and group motorcycling) may prompt psychological growth in
cancer survivors (Burke & Sabiston, 2012; Dunn, Campbell, Penn,
Dwyer, & Chambers, 2009; Hefferon, Grealy, & Mutrie, 2008;

McDonough, Sabiston, & Ullrich-French, 2011; Sabiston, McDonough, & Crocker, 2007).
Based on posttraumatic growth theory and preliminary
research, we propose that activities that push cancer survivors
beyond their current capacity and provide a sense of accomplishment may be most likely to foster positive growth. Accordingly, we
propose that the optimal physical activities for stimulating posttraumatic growth would be physically challenging (i.e., a high
physiological demand), novel (i.e., not common or everyday activities), and contain some element of physical risk (i.e., potentially
serious injury if a mistake is made). The term “extreme/adventure
activities” has become a general descriptor for these types of activities (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2013). Moreover, we propose that
posttraumatic growth is most likely to occur when the cancer
diagnosis itself prompts the cancer survivor to participate in
extreme/adventure activities.
The primary objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and interest in extreme/adventure activities in GCS and
determine any associations with posttraumatic growth. Based on
posttraumatic growth theory and previous research (Burke &
Sabiston, 2012; Dunn et al., 2009; Hefferon et al., 2008;
McDonough et al., 2011; Sabiston et al., 2007), we hypothesized
that few GCS would be participating in extreme/adventure activities but that those GCS who were participating would report
higher posttraumatic growth. Based on previous research
(Blanchard et al., 2003), we also hypothesized that few GCS would
report their cancer diagnosis prompted them to substantially
change the amount, type, or nature of their exercise (i.e., reported
exercise growth) but those who did report exercise growth would
also report higher posttraumatic growth.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
The design and methods of this cross-sectional, populationbased study have been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014).
Ethical approval was granted by the Alberta Cancer Research Ethics
Board. Eligibility criteria included: (a) 18 years of age and (b)
histologically confirmed gynecologic (cervical, endometrial, or
ovarian) cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 2013. The Alberta
Cancer Registry generated a random sample of 2064 GCS stratified
by cancer type (688 from each survivor group) who were then
contacted by the registry on behalf of the researchers. The survey
was conducted between July and November 2013. Eligible GCS were
mailed a study package containing: (a) a letter of invitation from
the Registry explaining the purpose of the Registry and its role in
this specific study, (b) a letter from the researchers explaining the
study, (c) the survey booklet, and (d) a postage paid return envelope. The survey protocol followed a modified version of the Total
Design Method (Dillman, 2007) where participants were mailed (a)
the initial study package, (b) a postcard reminder 3e4 weeks later
to nonresponders, and (c) a second survey 3e4 weeks after that to
nonresponders to the initial survey and postcard reminder.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Demographic and medical information
Medical and demographic variables were assessed by self-report
and included age, marital status, education, annual income,
employment status, ethnicity, height and weight to calculate body
mass index (BMI), date of diagnosis, type of gynecologic cancer
(cervical, endometrial, ovarian), disease stage (localized, metastasized), previous and current treatments (surgery, radiation,
chemotherapy/drugs), previous recurrence (no or yes), and current
disease status (“cancer is gone” versus “still have cancer”).
2.2.2. Participation and interest in extreme/adventure activity
We were unaware of any published scales that have been validated for the assessment of extreme/adventure activities. Based on
definitions of extreme sport (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2013) and
adventure therapy (Epstein, 2004), we defined extreme/adventure
activities for participants as physically challenging activities
involving speed, height and/or a high level of physical exertion such
as mountaineering, white water rafting, triathlon, marathon, scuba
diving, rock climbing, dragon boating and downhill skiing.
Extreme/adventure activity participation was assessed using one
item (i.e., have you participated in any extreme/adventure activity
in the past year) with a yes or no response; and one open-ended
question (i.e., if yes, what type of extreme/adventure activity(ies)
did you do).
For participants interested in participating in a future exercise
study, we asked “would you be interested in trying any extreme/
adventure type activities” with a yes or no response. If participants
selected yes, they were asked to choose which extreme/adventure
activities they were most interested in trying from a list of options
that included wall/rock climbing, mountaineering (hiking),
triathlon, waterskiing/wakeboarding, river rafting, kayaking, scuba
diving, mountain biking, cross country skiing, downhill skiing,
horseback riding and other.
2.2.3. Posttraumatic growth
Given the exploratory nature of this study, posttraumatic
growth was assessed by three scales. The primary posttraumatic
growth scale was the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)
(Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI is a 21-item questionnaire
with a six-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (I did not experience
this change as a result of my crisis) to 5 (I experienced this change
as a result of my crisis). The PTGI is scored by the sum of the 21
items where higher scores indicated greater posttraumatic growth.
The Impact of Cancer Scale (IOC) was a second measure of posttraumatic growth (Zebrack, Yi, Petersen, & Ganz, 2008). The IOC
consists of 41 items comprising 5 positive subscales (health
awareness, positive self-evaluation, positive outlook, value of relationships, meaning of cancer) and 5 negative subscales (body
changes, negative self-evaluation, negative outlook, life interferences, health worry). Respondents indicated the extent to
which they agree from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
The Benefit Finding Scale (BFS) was used to assess the ways gynecologic cancer may have had a positive impact (Tomich & Helgeson,
2006). The BFS is a 14-item questionnaire with a 4-point scale
ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The BFS is scored by
summing the 14-items, with higher scores indicating more benefits
from cancer.
2.2.4. Exercise growth
We were interested in the extent to which a diagnosis and
treatment of gynecologic cancer may have prompted participation
in extreme/adventure activities but we were unaware of any validated scales assessing such a construct. Consequently, we
embedded six “exercise growth” items in the PTGI scale. As noted
earlier, the PTGI scale asks “how your diagnosis and treatment for
gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, or cervical) may have
changed your life” with responses ranging from 0 (I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis) to 5 (I experienced this
change as a result of my crisis). The six exercise growth items
focused on changes in the amount, type, and nature of exercise in
order to tap aspects related to physically challenging, novel, and
high risk extreme/adventure activities. The specific items were: “I
have significantly increased the amount of exercise I do”, “I have
36 J.J. Crawford et al. / Mental Health and Physical Activity 9 (2015) 35e40
tried new exercises I have never done before”, “I have taken up a
mind-body exercise such as yoga or tai chi”, “I have taken up a new
sport that I never played before such as tennis or golf”, “I have taken
up a physically challenging activity such as marathon running or
triathlon”, and “I have taken up a high risk sport or activity such as
rock climbing or white water rafting.”
2.2.5. Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL). We conducted analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs)
comparing those participating versus not participating and those
interested versus not interested in extreme/adventure activities on
the PTGI, PIOC, NIOC, and BFS. Our analyses adjusted for age, type of
cancer, BMI, months since diagnosis, radiation treatment, and
chemotherapy treatment. We also conducted ANCOVAs to examine
differences in posttraumatic growth based on the six exercise
growth items by creating four categories of exercise growth: (1) no
change (0 ¼ did not experience this change), (2) very small/small
change (1e2 ¼ changed to a very small/small degree), (3) moderate
change (3 ¼ changed to a moderate degree), and (4) great/very
great change (4e5 ¼ changed to a great/very great degree). Finally,
we performed forced entry multiple regression analyses to determine the independent associations of each of the six exercise
growth variables with PTGI, PIOC, NIOC, and BFS, adjusting for the
same variables as in our main analyses.
3. Results
Flow of participants through the study has been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014). Briefly, of the 2064 mailed surveys,
621 surveys were completed resulting in a completion rate of 30%
(621/2064) and a response rate of 38% (621/1626) excluding those
that were returned to sender or not eligible. Demographic and
medical data have been reported elsewhere (Crawford et al., 2014).
In summary, the mean age of participants was 60.8 ± 12.2 years,
71.5% were married, and 47.3% had completed university/college.
The mean BMI was 28.2 ± 6.6 with 64.4% of participants being
classified as overweight or obese. For type of cancer, 40.3% had
ovarian cancer, 27.4% had endometrial cancer, and 32.4% had cervical cancer. Based on the limited data available in the Alberta
Cancer Registry, we found our sample was similar to nonresponders in age, radiation treatment, and surgery treatment but
slightly over-represented ovarian cancer survivors, chemotherapy
treatment, and were closer to their date of diagnosis (Crawford
et al., 2014).
3.1. Participation and interest in extreme/adventure activities
Overall, 12.1% (n ¼ 75) of GCS reported that they had participated in an extreme/adventure activity over the past year (Table 1).
Downhill skiing was the most frequently reported activity (29.4%)
followed by mountaineering (17.5%) and cross-country skiing
(8.7%). Of the 309 (49.8%) GCS interested in a future exercise study,
41.1% (127 out of 309) indicated they would be interested in trying
an extreme/adventure activity. The extreme/adventure activity of
most interest was cross-country skiing (56.9%) followed by horseback riding (51.5%) and river rafting (41.5%).
3.2. Exercise growth
Descriptive statistics for the exercise growth variables are displayed in Table 2. Results indicated that GCS reported the largest
change for increasing the amount of exercise (38.8%) followed by
trying new exercises (32.4%), taking up mind body exercises
(16.3%), taking up a new sport (10.7%), taking up a physically
challenging activity (5.5%), and taking up a higher risk sport or
activity (2.8%).
3.3. Associations between extreme/adventure activities and
posttraumatic growth
ANCOVAs indicated no significant differences for participation
or interest in extreme/adventure activities for the PTGI, PIOC, NIOC,
and BFS (Table 3).
3.4. Associations between exercise growth and posttraumatic
growth
Table 4 reports the differences in posttraumatic growth based
on the exercise growth items. All exercise growth items were
significantly associated with all posttraumatic growth scales
(Ps < 0.05). In forced entry multivariate regression analyses, the
exercise growth items explained 37.2% (p < 0.001) of the variance in
PTGI, 7.2% (p < 0.001) of the variance in the NIOC, 19.9% (p < 0.001)
of the variance in the PIOC, and 23.0% of the variance in BFS. For the
PTGI, the significant independent correlates were increasing the
amount of exercise (b ¼ 0.36; p < 0.001), trying new exercises

(b ¼ 0.10; p ¼ 0.020).
4. Discussion
Our results showed that only 12.1% (n ¼ 75) of GCS reported
participating in extreme/adventure activities in the past year with
the most popular activities being downhill skiing, mountaineering,
and cross-country skiing. There are no published studies that have
examined extreme/adventure activity participation in cancer survivors with which to compare our results. This rate of participation
is higher than the 5% reported in the general adult population
(Tomlinson, Ravenscroft, Wheaton, & Gilchrist, 2005) although
participation rates have continued to grow (Brymer & Schweitzer,
2013). Interestingly, about 40% of GCS interested in participating
in a future exercise study were interested in trying extreme/
adventure activities with the strongest interest in cross country
skiing (56.9%), horseback riding (51.5%), and river rafting (41.5%).
These findings suggest that extreme/adventure activity interventions may be of interest to GCS despite limited current
participation.
GCS also reported modest exercise growth as a result of their
diagnosis. About one-third of GCS reported that their diagnosis and
treatments prompted them to increase the amount of exercise and
try new exercises; however, fewer than 10% reported that it
prompted them to take up a new sport, take up a physically challenging activity, or take up a high-risk sport or activity. The proportion of GCS that increased the amount of exercise is about
double that reported for breast and other cancer survivors
(Blanchard et al., 2003), suggesting that a GCS diagnosis may be
especially motivating for exercise behavior change. The reasons for
the low rate of change in terms of trying a new sport, a physically
challenging activity, or a high risk activity are unclear. It is possible
that the low rate of change in these variables may be due to the age
range of participants in the present study. Previously, extreme/
adventure activities tended to be popular among younger people;
however, the demographics of participants in extreme/adventure
sports are broadening to include people of all ages and women
(Celsi, Rose, & Leigh, 1993; Willig, 2008).
Contrary to our hypothesis, our data indicated that extreme/
adventure activity participation and interest was not associated
with posttraumatic growth. Observational research has indicated
that those who push their boundaries and overcome physical and
psychological challenges by taking up a new or physically challenging activities such as mountaineering, dragon boating, or
motorcycling, have reported improved posttraumatic growth
(Burke & Sabiston, 2012; Dunn et al., 2009; McDonough et al., 2011;
Sabiston et al., 2007). One potential explanation for our finding is
that a single participation in an extreme/adventure activity in the
past year may not be sufficient to change posttraumatic growth.
Unfortunately, we did not ask about the frequency of participation
in our survey. A second possible explanation is that the low
numbers of GCS who had participated in any extreme/adventure
activity may have limited our ability to find an association. Finally, it
is also possible that the GCS who participated in extreme/adventure activities in the past year were the same ones who had
participated prediagnosis, thereby, not experiencing any change in

these activities which may be the critical factor in prompting
posttraumatic growth.
This last explanation is bolstered by our results showing that all
exercise growth items were significantly associated with all posttraumatic growth scales. These data suggest that GCS who changed
the amount, type, or nature of their exercise activities experienced
higher posttraumatic growth. These results are consistent with
observational studies with breast cancer survivors that found
emotionally and physically taxing activities may provide a medium
for physical and psychological growth (Burke & Sabiston, 2010,
2012; Dunn et al., 2009; Sabiston et al., 2007). Moreover, it was
not only an increase in the amount of exercise that was associated
with posttraumatic growth but also trying new activities and high
risk activities. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that
activities that are physically challenging, novel, and contain some
risk may be more likely to prompt posttraumatic growth in GCS.
Future research examining whether exercise growth is associated
with posttraumatic growth in other cancer survivor populations is
warranted.
Our study has several strengths and limitations that need to be
recognized. The strengths of our study include being the first to
examine extreme/adventure activities and posttraumatic growth in
GCS. Moreover, we obtained a large population-based sample of
GCS that was fairly representative of the GCS population of Alberta
and used validated measures of posttraumatic growth. One limitation of this study is the use of researcher-developed scales for
extreme/adventure activity participation as well as exercise
growth. The cross-sectional design is also a limitation. Moreover,
our research should be replicated in different climates and countries, as different opportunities for extreme/adventure activities
may exist.
In summary, we examined the associations between extreme/
adventure activities and posttraumatic growth in a populationbased sample of 621 GCS. We found that neither participation nor
interest in extreme/adventure activities was associated with posttraumatic growth in GCS; however, exercise growth (i.e., changes in
the amount, type, and nature of exercise prompted by the cancer
diagnosis) was strongly associated with posttraumatic growth.
Future research examining the outcomes and determinants of
adventure/extreme activities in GCS and other cancer survivor
populations are warranted.
