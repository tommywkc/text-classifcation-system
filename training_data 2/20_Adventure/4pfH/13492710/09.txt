Abstract
We studied the changes in salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and other psychophysiological indices (heart rate, skin
conductance, and corrugator supercilii activity) elicited by sustained exposure to affective pictures. Thirty-nine subjects
viewed five blocks of pictures depicting mutilations, human attack, neutral scenes, sport/adventure, and erotica. Each
block comprised 12 pictures of the same content. Saliva samples were collected before and after each block of pictures.
The results showed that mutilation pictures promoted the greatest increase in sAA activity and output, as well as greater
corrugator supercilii activity than pleasant pictures. Skin conductance response did not differ among high arousal picture
contents. Changes in sAA varied with the affective valence but not with the arousal ratings of the pictures. Our results
point to sAA as an index directly related to the unpleasantness elicited by sustained exposure to affective stimuli.

Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) enzyme is produced by the salivary
glands and is related to the digestion of macromolecules and the
maintenance of oral health (Granger, Kivlighan, El-Sheikh, Gordis,
& Stroud, 2007). In recent years, interest in sAA secretion has
grown in psychophysiological research because it has been considered as a noninvasive index of autonomic nervous system (ANS)
activation (Bosch, Veerman, De Geus, & Proctor, 2011; Ehlert,
Erni, Hebisch, & Nater, 2006; Nater & Rohleder, 2009; Rohleder &
Nater, 2009).
Salivary alpha-amylase activity has been employed as an indirect measure of the amount (concentration) of sAA enzyme in
saliva and has been related to sympathetic nervous system activity
(Bosch et al., 2011; Nater & Rohleder, 2009; Rohleder & Nater,
2009). Parasympathetic activity, however, also influences sAA
secretion since (a) some salivary glands are mainly parasympathetically innervated, (b) sAA secretion is greater during concomitant sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve stimulation in
comparison to individual sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve
stimulation (Asking, 1985; Asking & Gjorstrup, 1987), and (c)
sAA secretion is related to the salivary flow rate, which is mainly
determined by parasympathetic activity (Proctor & Carpenter,
2007). Bosch et al. (2011) note that there is often confusion in sAA
research due to the absence of a measure of the secretion rate.
Salivary alpha-amylase output is associated with the enzymatic
activity in relation to the salivary flow rate over a fixed period of
time and constitutes, therefore, a better estimate of sympathetic
activity associated to sAA secretion (Bosch et al., 2011; Proctor &
Carpenter, 2007).
Previous research has linked sAA secretion to norepinephrine
(NE) levels. In this line, two pharmacological studies have
reported that sAA activity increases after the yohimbine test
(Ehlert et al., 2006), and decreases after the administration of propanolol (van Stegeren, Rohleder, Everaerd, & Wolf, 2006).
However, the data associating sAA activity with the peripheral NE
levels are weak, in spite of the involvement of this neurotransmitter in sAA release (Nater & Rohleder, 2009). Alternatively, some
authors have proposed that sAA levels may be an indirect marker
of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and, therefore,
related to central NE activity (e.g., Ehlert et al., 2006; Hermans
et al., 2011; Segal & Cahill, 2009; van Stegeren et al., 2006;
Weymar et al., 2010).
A number of studies have found an increase in sAA levels
associated with the experience of fear, anxiety, and psychological
stress (Nater & Rohleder, 2009; Rohleder & Nater, 2009). For
instance, sAA increases have been reported in subjects exposed to
laboratory psychosocial stressors, such as the Trier Social Stress

Test (Gordis, Granger, Susman, & Trickett, 2006; Het & Wolf,
2007; Nater et al., 2005, 2006; Payne et al., 2007; Rohleder,
Nater, Wolf, Ehlert, & Kirschbaum, 2004), and in subjects
exposed to purely cognitive stressors (Bosch, de Geus, Veerman,
Hoogstraten, & Nieuw Amerongen, 2003; Skosnik, Chatterton,
Swisher, & Park, 2000). An increase in sAA levels has also been
found in subjects exposed to aversive emotional stimuli, such as
unpleasant videos depicting surgical operations or child maltreatment (Bosch et al., 2003; Takai et al., 2004; Tu, Lupien, &
Walker, 2006), as well as affective pictures (Segal & Cahill, 2009;
van Stegeren et al., 2006; Weymar et al., 2010). In addition, ecological situations have been found to increase the sAA activity
levels, e.g., exposure to a real magnetic resonance imaging procedure (van Stegeren et al., 2006), academic stress (Bosch et al.,
1996; Chatterton, Vogelsong, Lu, Ellman, & Hudgens, 1996), preparing for one’s first skydive (Chatterton, Vogelsong, Lu, &
Hudgens, 1997), and a naturalistic fear challenge (Buchanan,
Bibas, & Adolphs, 2010).
While previous research has pointed to a relation between sAA
and the experience of negative emotions elicited by aversive situations, it remains to be investigated whether the sAA response is
related to other parameters of the affective stimuli, such as arousal
level and specific content. According to Lang and co-workers
(Lang, 1995; Lang & Bradley, 2010; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert,
1997), emotion can be considered as a tendency or disposition to
action that is supported by two motivational systems in the
brain—the appetitive system (related to approach behaviors) and
the defensive system (related to withdrawal or fight-or-flight
behaviors). Accordingly, emotions can be described by two basic
bipolar dimensions—affective valence, related to the dominant
motivational system (pleasant-appetitive or unpleasant-defensive)
and arousal, related to the intensity or degree of activation of these
motivational systems (Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, & Lang,
2001; Lang et al., 1997). Studies conducted in laboratory settings
have demonstrated that behavioral and physiological indices of
the emotional response depend on affective valence and arousal of
the affective stimuli (Bradley & Lang, 2007; Bradley et al., 2001;
Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993; Sánchez-Navarro,
Martínez-Selva, Torrente, & Román, 2008). Previous findings
employing a picture perception paradigm show, for instance, that
the largest skin conductance responses are promoted by the most
arousing pictures (either pleasant or unpleasant), while heart rate
and corrugator supercilii muscle activity depend on affective
valence, with unpleasant pictures eliciting a marked heart rate
deceleration and an increase in corrugator supercilii activity
(Bradley et al., 2001; Sánchez-Navarro, Martínez-Selva, &
Román, 2006). In the case of continuous exposure to aversive
pictures, these changes would reflect sympathetic mobilization
and increased defence activation (Smith, Bradley, & Lang, 2005;
Wangelin, Löw, McTeague, Bradley, & Lang, 2011). Accordingly,
a neuroendocrinological study using prolonged exposure to affective pictures has reported increases in NE, corticotropine, and cortisol levels as a response to pictures depicting mutilations (highly
unpleasant and arousing), which were greater than the increases
promoted by the sustained viewing of a series of either erotic or
neutral pictures (Codispoti et al., 2003). These results are consistent with other works relating the NE system activity to the defensive activation promoted by the exposure to aversive stimuli (e.g.,
Levine, Litto, & Jacobs, 1990; Lovallo & Thomas, 2000).
Following these data, and in accordance with previous
research relating sAA levels to central NE activity (e.g., Ehlert
et al., 2006), the sAA response promoted by emotional situations
could be expected to depend on unpleasantness rather than on the
arousal elicited by such stimuli. In addition, given that previous
research has shown that specific contents of pleasant (erotic and
sport/adventure) and unpleasant (mutilation and threat) pictures
promote different physiological responses (Bernat, Patrick,
Benning, & Tellegen, 2006; Bradley et al., 2001), we wished to
explore the sAA response prompted by continuous exposure to
specific emotional contents varying in affective valence and
arousal. For this purpose, we compared the sAA changes promoted by the sustained viewing of blocks of pictures depicting
unpleasant, high arousal scenes (mutilations and human attack),
pleasant, high arousal contents (erotica and sport/adventure), and
pictures portraying neutral, low arousal scenes (household
objects).
From previous research relating the increase of sAA levels to
the experience of aversive situations (e.g., Bosch et al., 2003;
Buchanan et al., 2010; Nater & Rohleder, 2009), we expected that
sAA activity and output would vary with the affective valence of
blocks of pictures, with unpleasant pictures (mutilations and
human attack) promoting greater changes than neutral and pleasant (erotica and sport/adventure) ones. In order to objectively
measure the emotional reactivity elicited by the exposure to the
affective pictures, we recorded heart rate (HR), skin conductance
response (SCR), and corrugator supercilii electromyographic
(EMG) activity. We expected to find the greatest corrugator
supercilii activity promoted by the continuous viewing of
unpleasant pictures (mutilations and human attack), and the greatest number of SCRs elicited by the sustained exposure to arousing pictures (either pleasant or unpleasant), replicating previous
results (e.g., Bradley, Cuthbert, & Lang, 1996; Smith et al.,
2005). Regarding HR, and again following previous research
(Pastor et al., 2008; Wangelin et al., 2011), we expected the
presentation of the pictures in content blocks to lead to a slower
heart rate, particularly in the case of pleasant and unpleasant
pictures.
Method
Participants
Participants were 39 healthy student volunteers (19 women)
selected from the University of Málaga who received course
credits for their participation. Inclusion criteria for participation
were no history of psychiatric, neurological, endocrine, immunological, and cardiovascular diseases. Medication with psychoactive drugs, beta-blockers, or glucocorticoids was considered as a
criterion for exclusion. One subject was excluded because of
problems with the saliva collection, and three more subjects were
excluded from the study because of extreme data in their saliva
samples (higher than 2.5 standard deviations). The final sample
consisted of 35 subjects (17 women) aged between 20 and 55
(M = 23.85, SD = 6.51). One subject who did not complete the
rating of the pictures was excluded from picture ratings and correlation analyses (N = 34). In a prestudy session, all subjects
signed a written consent to participate in the study and answered
the 72-item Fear Survey Schedule (Wolpe & Lang, 1964), obtaining ratings between 89 and 202 (M = 138.81, SD = 34.32), and the
Mutilation Questionnaire (Klorman, Hastings, Weerts, Melamed,
& Lang, 1974), with ratings between 5 and 18 (M = 10.97,
SD = 3.31).
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Materials and Design
We selected 60 affective pictures1 from the International Affective
Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2008), according to the normative ratings for the Spanish population (Moltó
et al., 1999; Vila et al., 2001). Pictures were chosen so as to comprise five specific contents, including two unpleasant, high arousal
contents (human attack and illness/mutilations), one neutral,
low arousal content (household objects), and two pleasant, high
arousal contents (erotic couples and sport/adventure). The five
categories differed in affective valence, F(4,44) = 572.95, p < .001
(mutilations = human attack < neutral < sport/adventure = erotic).
Mutilation and human attack pictures did not differ in their affective valence, and they were more unpleasant than all the other
contents (ps < .001), whereas erotic and sport/adventure pictures
did not differ in affective valence and were more pleasant than the
rest of the contents (ps < .001). Arousal level differed also between
categories, F(4,44) = 378.29, p < .001. Mutilation, human attack,
erotic, and sport/adventure pictures did not differ in their arousal
ratings, and all of them were more arousing than neutral pictures
(ps < .001 for all comparisons).
We constructed five different blocks of pictures. Each block
consisted of 12 pictures of the same content. Pictures were presented consecutively for 10 s each, with no interpicture interval.
Following previous research (e.g., Takai et al., 2004), the interblock interval was 630 s to facilitate the return of sAA levels to
baseline levels. To avoid any effect of the order of presentation of
the blocks on the responses measured, we constructed three different presentation orders, and each subject was randomly assigned to
one of them. In each presentation order, two consecutive blocks of
the same affective valence were not allowed, and within each
block, pictures were presented in the same order for all subjects.
Samples of saliva were collected before and after each block of
pictures. The pictures, as well as all the task instructions, were
presented through a 19-inch computer monitor placed in front of
the subject.
Saliva Collection, Biochemical Analyses, and Data Reduction
For saliva collection, the passive drooling method was modified
from the original procedure suggested by Navazesh (1993) as
described by Rohleder, Wolf, Maldonado, & Kirschbaum (2006).
Participants were instructed first to void their mouth of saliva by
swallowing. In contrast to the original method, saliva was then
allowed to accumulate passively (without tongue movements) for
2 min (instead of 5 min). Participants then spit all saliva into 10-ml
polystyrene tubes. This procedure was practiced during a prestudy
session for all the participants, who received a written description
of the full process. A researcher monitored the sampling procedure
through a closed-circuit television system.
Saliva samples were frozen immediately and stored at -20°C
until analysis. After thawing, tubes used for passive drooling were
centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, thus restricting mucous compounds to the lower part of the tube. Each saliva sample was then
diluted 1 mL:750 mL in distilled water. Alpha-amylase activity was
determined using the clinical chemistry system Dimension (Dade
Behring) and assay kits for amylase obtained from Dade Behring.
The AMY method in this system (which responds to both pancreatic and salivary amylase isoenzymes) uses a chromogenic substrate, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol linked with maltotriose. The direct
reaction of alpha-amylase with the substrate leads to the formation
of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol, which is monitored spectrophotometrically. The activity is determined by measuring the absorbance
through the formation of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol using a bichromatic (405,577 nm) rate technique. Formation of 2-chloro-4-
nitrophenol is proportional to the sAA activity, and was expressed
as U/ml.
In order to obtain a measure of sAA output, saliva flow rate
(SFR) was calculated by the gravimetric method, assuming the
density of saliva as 1.0 g/ml (Chicharro, Lucía, Pérez, Vaquero, &
Urena, 1998). Saliva obtained after 2 min of passive drooling was
weighed, and flow rate was expressed in ml/min (g/min). Salivary
alpha-amylase output was then computed by multiplication of SFR
(ml/min) with sAA activity (U/ml), and expressed as U/min.
Salivary alpha-amylase activity and output data were tested
for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene’s tests. Due to positively
skewed distributions of salivary alpha-amylase activity and output,
parameters were log-transformed to approximate normal distribution. Thus, for each block of pictures we obtained the change score
(postblock minus preblock) for both sAA activity and output.
Psychophysiological Recording and Data Reduction
The physiological signals were acquired, amplified, and filtered by
an AD Instruments PowerLab\8SP data acquisition system (16-bit
A/D converter). All physiological signals were continuously
sampled at 1000 Hz for the entire recording.
Lead-3 electrocardiogram was recorded by means of 7-mm
Ag/AgCl surface electrodes filled with a hypertonic electrolyte
paste. The raw signal was amplified, and frequencies below 0.3 Hz
and above 100 Hz were filtered out. Heart rate was obtained by the
offline transformation of the R-wave, using an automatic procedure
to detect R-waves and to make corrections for false R-wave detection (heart periods shorter than 300 ms), providing a weighted
mean of the beat-to-beat HR. Raw HR was averaged for each block
of pictures. Skin conductance was obtained by the bipolar placement of 7-mm Ag/AgCl standard surface electrodes filled with an
isotonic electrolyte paste on the thenar (C6) and hypothenar (C8)
eminences of the nondominant hand surface. The raw signal was
calibrated to detect activity in the 0–100 microSiemens range.
Following previous research (e.g., Bradley et al., 1996; Wangelin
et al., 2011), we recorded the number of skin conductance
responses higher than .05 mSiemens during each block of pictures.
Corrugator supercilii EMG activity was recorded from the left side
of the face through bipolar placement of 4-mm Ag/AgCl surface
electrodes (Fridlund & Cacioppo, 1986). The raw EMG signal was
amplified, frequencies below 10 Hz and above 500 Hz were filtered
out, and a notch filter was used to eliminate 50-Hz noise. The signal
was full-wave rectified and integrated offline with a time constant
of 500 ms. Raw corrugator supercilii EMG activity was averaged
for each block of pictures.
Procedure
The experiment was conducted between 13:00 and 18:00 to control
the circadian effects associated with the changes in the levels of

3051, 3060, 3064, 3071, 3080, 3110, 3130, 3150, 3400, 3550, 9405. Human

sAA activity and output (Nater, Rohleder, Schlotz, Ehlert, &
Kirschbaum, 2007; Rohleder et al., 2004). Subjects were instructed
to avoid any food during the 2 h prior to the experimental session.
Participants were accommodated in an armchair located 0.5 m
in front of a computer screen, and all sensors were attached. Subjects were informed that a series of pictures would be displayed
consecutively on the screen and that they should pay attention to
each picture for its entire display length. In addition, they were also
informed that all the instructions concerning each step of the task
(e.g., accumulate saliva, dribble saliva, etc.) would be displayed on
the screen. The task comprised a 3-min rest period followed by the
presentation of the five blocks of pictures. Before each block,
subjects were required, through a message on the screen, to accumulate saliva in their mouth for 2 min (see Figure 1). After this
period, a new message appeared indicating that they could dribble
the saliva into a polystyrene tube. Then, the pictures of the first
block were started. After the picture block offset, subjects were
again required to accumulate saliva in their mouth for 2 min. After
this period, a new message indicated that they could dribble the
saliva into another polystyrene tube. Then, a 270-s rest period
started. After this period, the sequence began again until the completion of the five blocks of pictures.
After the psychophysiological task, electrodes were removed
and the saliva samples were placed inside the freezer. Subjects were
then asked to view each picture again in a free viewing time setting
and to rate the affective valence and arousal of each picture using
a computerized version of the Self-Assessment Manikin, based on
the original paper and pencil version (Hodes, Cook, & Lang, 1985).
This computerized version presents separately, after each picture, a
9-point rating scale for each dimension, with 9 representing a high
rating (i.e., high pleasure, high arousal), and 1 a low rating (i.e., low
pleasure, low arousal). The presentation order of the pictures was
the same as in the psychophysiological task.
Statistical Analysis
The effects of the five blocks of pictures on each dependent variable were studied by a repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with picture category (mutilation, human attack,
neutral, sport/adventure, and erotic) as within-subjects factor.
In order to study the relation between the sAA levels promoted
by the full set of pictures and the affective valence and arousal
reported by the subjects, we conducted bivariate correlations
between the subjects’ ratings of affective valence and arousal and
the change scores of sAA (activity and output).
All the statistical analyses were performed with the PASW
package (version 19; SPSS, Chicago, IL). A measure of the effect
size, partial eta-squared (h2
), was obtained for the main statistical
tests. When appropriate, a Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the
degrees of freedom was used in repeated-measures tests in order to
correct any potential inflation of the reported probability values,
and epsilon values (e) are reported (Bagiella, Sloan, & Heitjan,
2000). Post hoc comparisons were performed with a Bonferroni
correction to control the overall level of significance (Keselman,
1998).
Results
Affective Picture Ratings
Affective valence ratings differed according to picture category,
F(4,132) = 119.89, p < .001, h2 = .784. All pictures differed in
affective valence (all ps < .001) except for erotic and sport/
adventure pictures (see Table 1).
Arousal ratings also varied depending on picture category,
F(4,132) = 48.75, p < .001, h2 = .596 (see Table 1). Mutilation pictures were rated highest in arousal (all ps < .003). Human attack,
erotic, and sport/adventure pictures did not differ in arousal ratings,
which were higher than the arousal assigned to neutral pictures
(all ps < .001).
Salivary Alpha-Amylase Levels Elicited by the Pictures
Salivary alpha-amylase activity. A significant main effect was
found for picture category, F(4,136) = 2.44, p = .05, h2 = .067. As
shown in Figure 2 (top), when sAA activity was arranged according
to the affective valence, values followed a marginally significant
linear trend from the lowest (sport/adventure) to the highest (mutilation) levels, F(1,34) = 3.52, p = .069, h2 = .094. Bonferroni corrected paired comparisons showed differences only between
mutilation and sport/adventure pictures, p = .002, but, as can be
seen in Table 2, only the sustained exposure to mutilation pictures
promoted a significant increase in sAA activity.
Salivary alpha-amylase output. The statistical analyses showed
a main effect of picture category, F(4,136) = 3.64, p = .014,

e = .774, h2 = .097. When sAA output values were arranged
according to the affective valence (see Figure 2, bottom), values
followed a significant linear trend from the lowest (sport/
adventure) to the highest (mutilation) levels, F(1,34) = 10.49,
p < .001, h2 = .236. Bonferroni corrected paired comparisons
showed, however, differences only between mutilation and sport/
adventure pictures (p < .001). Additional analyses showed that sustained exposure to pictures depicting mutilation scenes promoted a
significant increase in sAA output, whereas human attack elicited a
near significant increase (see Table 2).
Correlation analyses. Salivary alpha-amylase output showed a
significant negative correlation only with the affective valence
ratings of the pictures, r = -.284, p < .001, but not with the
arousal ones (p = .68). Regarding sAA activity, a marginally significant negative correlation was also found with the affective

Psychophysiological Responses Promoted by the Pictures
Skin conductance response. The number of SCRs elicited by the
pictures depended on picture category, F(4,136) = 8.19, p < .001,
e = .825, h2 = .194. When SCRs were arranged according to the
affective valence, a significant quadratic trend was observed,
F(1,34) = 15.36, p < .001, h2 = .311. Paired comparisons showed
that the exposure to high arousal, emotional pictures did not differ
in the number of SCRs they elicited (see Table 1), except for
sport/adventure pictures, which promoted fewer SCRs than mutilation ones (p = .003). In addition, mutilation, human attack, and
erotic pictures promoted more SCRs than neutral pictures (all
ps < .001), while sport/adventure pictures did not differ from
neutral ones.
Heart rate. The analysis of the raw heart rate did not show
any statistical differences for picture category, F(4,136) = 1.24,
p = .300. When HR was arranged according to affective valence,
contrast analyses showed a significant quadratic trend, F(1,34) =
4.28, p = .046, h2 = .112. As can be seen in Table 1, all the blocks
of affective pictures promoted a slightly slower HR than the
neutral one.
Corrugator supercilii EMG activity. Corrugator supercilii EMG
activity varied depending on picture category, F(4,136) = 5.07,
p = .005, e = .597, h2 = .130. A significant linear trend was found
when EMG values were arranged according to affective valence,
F(1,34) = 9.13, p = .005, h2 = .212. Paired comparisons showed
that continuous viewing of pictures depicting mutilation significantly elicited greater EMG activity than exposure to erotic
(p = .003) and sport/adventure (p = .004) pictures (see Table 1).
Discussion
This research aimed to study the sAA response promoted by the
sustained exposure to different categories of affective pictures
varying in affective valence and arousal level. Our findings showed
that sAA levels markedly increased after viewing unpleasant pictures, particularly human mutilation ones. This finding is consistent
with those reports that have related the sAA increase to the reaction
promoted by aversive situations and the parallel activation of the
ANS (e.g., Buchanan et al., 2010; Nater et al., 2006; van Stegeren
et al., 2006). Previous research has considered sAA levels as an
indirect index of NE (see Ehlert et al., 2006). Peripheral NE
increases have been found during sustained exposure to unpleasant
mutilation pictures, in comparison to viewing a prolonged series of
erotic and neutral pictures (Codispoti et al., 2003). In line with the
above proposals relating sAA with ANS activation (e.g., Bosch
et al., 2011; Nater & Rohleder, 2009), our data are consistent with
those obtained by Codispoti et al., and point to a relation between
the unpleasantness of the emotional situations and the sAA changes
they promote, probably reflecting a preparation of a fight-or-flight
response (Buchanan et al., 2010).
Previous research has found that the sustained exposure to a
series of pictures of the same affective valence leads to an increase,
or at least maintenance, of physiological reactivity (Bradley et al.,
1996). The sustained viewing of aversive pictures prompts a prolonged affective state and a number of psychophysiological reactions that reflect sympathetic mobilization and increased defensive
activation (Smith et al., 2005; Wangelin et al., 2011). Since mutilation, and also human attack pictures, are among the most
threatening pictures, promoting strong, defence-related, psychophysiological and somatic responses as well as high reports of
negative affect and arousal (e.g., Azevedo et al., 2005; Bradley
et al., 2001; Bradley, Hamby, Löw, & Lang, 2007), continuous
exposure to a series of these aversive contents leads to an increased
activation of the defensive system, which may correspond to the
imminence of a threat (Azevedo et al., 2005; Lang et al., 1997).
Hence, our psychophysiological data showed that prolonged exposure to mutilation pictures promoted an increase in the number of
SCRs, in comparison to exposure to neutral pictures, as well as the
greatest increase of the corrugator supercilii EMG activity, which
has been shown to be highest for the most unpleasant contents (e.g.,
Bradley et al., 2001; Sánchez-Navarro et al., 2006; Smith et al.,
2005). In addition to these responses, our data showed that mutilations also provoked a significant increase of sAA levels.
Whereas mutilation scenes promoted an increase of sAA levels,
human attack pictures promoted only a marginal increase. Previous
research has already proposed that physiological responses may
vary within both unpleasant and pleasant affective categories
(e.g., Bradley et al., 2001). Thus, in comparison to attack pictures,
mutilation scenes promote greater corrugator supercilii activity
(Bradley et al., 2001), a more extensive functional activation within
the posterior ventral cortex (Bradley et al., 2003), larger late positive components of the event-related potentials (De Cesarei &

Codispoti, 2011; Schupp et al., 2004), and smaller startle blink
magnitudes, related to larger inhibitory attentional processes
(Bradley et al., 2001). Our results give partial support to these
observations, since we did not find differences in the net increase of
sAA levels between mutilation and human attack pictures. In this
line, further research is needed to confirm a specific effect of
mutilation pictures on this response.
According to previous findings on the relation between sAA
increases and aversive situations, sAA could be proposed as a
specific index related to threat and fear, reflecting the activation of
the defence system (Buchanan et al., 2010). One related finding is
that sAA secretion is more sensitive to psychological stress than
other sympathetic markers, as reported by van Stegeren et al. (2006).
In this regard, Hermans et al. (2011) have found a relation between
sAAand a network of brain structures related to defensive activation
(including the amygdala, hypothalamus, and frontoinsular and anterior cingulate cortices) during exposure to aversive film clips.
Interestingly, sAA levels prompted by the full set of pictures
varied negatively with the affective valence ratings—that is, the
greater the unpleasantness, the greater the sAA increase—although
not with the arousal ratings. In addition, the frequency of SCRs, a
peripheral measure of physiological arousal (i.e., sympathetic
response mobilization) that has been clearly demonstrated to
increase when subjects are exposed to arousing either unpleasant or
pleasant stimuli (e.g., Bradley et al., 2001; Lang et al., 1993;
Sánchez-Navarro et al., 2008), did not differ between sustained
exposures to high arousal pictures of either category, that is, no
differences were found in the number of SCRs promoted by mutilations, human attack, and erotic pictures. These findings are in
agreement with previous proposals relating sAA reactivity with
aversive events (e.g., Bosch et al., 2003; Buchanan et al., 2010;
Nater & Rohleder, 2009), and extend this view by suggesting that
this activity varies with the hedonic tone of the eliciting affective
context or situation, but not with the emotional arousal.
The increased sensitivity of sAA levels to the valence dimension of the pictures might be due, therefore, to stronger ANS
reactions to unpleasant pictures. Human emotions are dispositions
to action or states of heightened vigilance and physiological mobilization that are associated with survival and that appear in
mammals when overt actions are delayed or inhibited (Lang,
Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1997). Viewing scenes related to primary
reinforcers (e.g., mutilation, attack, or erotic contents) strongly
activates the motivational systems, leading to an increase of the
physiological arousal (Bradley et al., 2001). Threatening or mutilation pictures engage the defence motivational system, which is
reflected in an increase of both sympathetic and parasympathetic
activity. The increase of the sympathetic reactivity prompts heightened skin conductance responses, similar to that elicited by the
most pleasant pictures, whereas the parasympathetic activity leads
to greater HR deceleration than pleasant contents (Bradley et al.,
2001; Lang et al., 1993). The concurrent activation of the parasympathetic system promoted by the aversive pictures would also lead
to an enhanced, or augmented, sAA secretion (Proctor & Carpenter,
2007). Hence, these autonomic influences might explain the
relation found in this research between sAA and affective valence,
as well as the difference between the skin conductance and
sAA responses, since sweat glands, on which electrodermal
activity depends, only have a sympathetic cholinergic innervation
(Dawson, Schell, & Filion, 2007).
A limitation of this study is the time points selected to collect
saliva samples. Previous research has found that viewing unpleasant video clips promotes a response 3 min after the film onset (e.g.,
Takai et al., 2004). But sAA increases have also been found to peak
around 5–10 min after the stressor (e.g., Nater et al., 2006) or video
clip onset (e.g., Takai et al., 2004). In addition, it has also been
found that sAA decreases immediately after video clip offset. Thus,
it is possible that we have not captured the peak of sAA response
because saliva was collected 2 min after each picture block offset.
This might constitute a limitation of this research if it is demonstrated that unpleasant or mutilation pictures promote not only
greater sAA levels but also shorter latencies to reach these levels in
comparison to other affective pictures. However, this aspect of the
sAA response was outside the scope of this research, and further
studies are necessary to check this effect. In addition, the fact that
paired comparisons showed differences only between mutilation
and sport/adventure pictures could be explained by this lack of the
sAA peak response. Future research should clarify this issue.
In conclusion, sustained exposure to aversive pictures prompts
a series of automatic responses, enhancing ANS reactivity and
defence activation (Lang & Bradley, 2010). These responses
include HR slowing, an increase in the number of SCRs, an
enhancement of corrugator supercilii EMG activity, and startle
reflex potentiation (e.g., Bradley et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2005).
Sustained viewing of aversive pictures, particularly mutilation
ones, also promotes an increase of sAA levels, probably reflecting,
at least in part, the surge of NE that characterizes the defensive
engagement. Moreover, our findings show that sAA levels vary
with the perceived affective valence of the eliciting stimuli, but not
with the arousal they promote. Consequently, sAA levels might
allow researchers to address a basic component of the emotional
response that complements other autonomic indices, such as skin
conductance, heart rate, and blood pressure
